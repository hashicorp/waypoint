# Access the Waypoint UI

The Waypoint server includes a user interface that allows you to view
builds, deployments, and releases for projects and applications by using your web browser.

### Authenticating

The web UI requires authentication. Waypoint uses a single command to automatically open the browser and authenticate your session:

```bash
$ waypoint ui -authenticate
```

-> Waypoint currently uses self-signed certificates for TLS. Your web browser
will require you to bypass a certificate warning to use the UI.

You can now view the application and associated operations and logs in the browser.
