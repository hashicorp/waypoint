## Editing your Path (Optional) ((#path))

If you do not want to copy Waypoint into a file already in your path, you
can edit your `PATH` to include a directory that contains the Waypoint binary.
This allows you to use the `waypoint` command without having to include the
full directory path to the binary.

See what is in your current `$PATH` definition.

```shell
$ echo $PATH
```

If you do not have an entry for the Waypoint binary, add the following line to your shell profile:

`export PATH=$PATH:my-directory-path-to-waypoint-binary`

For example: `export PATH=$PATH:~/enlistments/waypoint`

- To determine your shell, run `echo $SHELL`
- If using Bash, use `nano ~/.bash_profile` to edit your Bash profile.
- If using ZSH, use `nano ~/.zshrc` to edit your ZSH profile.
