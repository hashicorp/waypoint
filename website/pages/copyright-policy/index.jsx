          C. Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that
        was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the
        content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post
        and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s
        agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider, member, or user,
        must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the
        Designated Agent listed below:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or
          user;
        </li>
        <li>
          Identification of the material that has been removed or to which
          access has been disabled and the location at which the material
          appeared before it was removed or disabled;
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith
          belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of
          mistake or misidentification of the material; and
        </li>
        <li>
          Content provider’s, member’s or user’s name, address, telephone
          number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such
          person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for
          the judicial district in which the content provider’s, member’s or
          user’s address is located, or, if the content provider’s, member’s or
          user’s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial
          district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity
          will accept service of process from the person who provided
          notification of the alleged infringement.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may
        send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party
        informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or
        cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files
        an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or
        user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in
        10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at
        Company’s discretion.
