# Waypoint Commands (CLI)

Waypoint is controlled via a very easy to use command-line interface (CLI). Waypoint is only a single command-line application: `waypoint`. This application then takes a subcommand such as "artifact" or "deployment". The complete list of subcommands is in the navigation to the left.
