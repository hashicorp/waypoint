## Examples Repository

This walkthrough will use an [example NodeJS application](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples/tree/master/nomad/nodejs)
to show how to build, deploy, and release using Waypoint. This example is part of the [waypoint-samples](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples)
repository. You will need a local clone of this repository in order to leverage this guide.

Clone the repository.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git
cd waypoint-examples/nomad/nodejs
```

## A Nomad Environment

Waypoint supports Nomad both as a location for running the Waypoint server as well as for running application workloads. To get
started with Nomad we suggest reviewing the [HashiCorp Learn tutorials for Nomad](https://learn.hashicorp.com/nomad)

You will also want to export the `NOMAD_ADDR` environment variable. Waypoint will call this variable for interacting with the Nomad
environment.
