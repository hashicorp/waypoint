# Deploy an Example Application to Nomad

This walkthrough takes you through deploying applications to an existing Nomad cluster and will give you a quick overview of how Waypoint works.

If you would like to see how Waypoint deploys apps to Kubernetes, try the [Kubernetes walkthrough](/docs/getting-started/k8s-example-app).

- **Time required:** About 30 minutes.
- **Prerequisites:** Access to a Nomad environment and a copy of the [Waypoint Examples applications](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoiont-examples).
