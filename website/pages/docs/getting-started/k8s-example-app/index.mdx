# Deploy an Example Application to Kubernetes

This walkthrough takes you through using Waypoint to deploy applications onto Kubernetes and will give you a very quick overview of how Waypoint works.

- **Time required:** About 30 minutes.
- **Prerequisites:** Access to a running Kubernetes cluster, such as one running in a public cloud, in Docker for Desktop, or in KIND. You will also need to have a local copy of the [Waypoint Examples applications repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples).
