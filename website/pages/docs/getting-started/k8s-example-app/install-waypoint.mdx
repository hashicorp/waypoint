# Install Waypoint

-> Review the [prerequisites walkthrough](/docs/getting-started/k8s-example-app/install-prereqs) before installing
Waypoint.

Waypoint uses both a client and a server to build, deploy, and release applications. This is
all available from a single binary.

<!-- Make this a partial -->

## Download the Binary

To install Waypoint, find the appropriate package on [the releases site](https://go.hashi.co/waypoint-beta-binaries)
for your system and download it as a zip archive.

After downloading Waypoint, unzip the package. Waypoint runs as a single binary named `waypoint`. Any
other files in the package can be safely removed and Waypoint will still function.

To make the binary available from anywhere on your system, you can either
copy it into `/usr/local/bin` or add it to a different directory in your `PATH`. For
instructions on how to do that, see [Editing your Path](#path).

```
$ cp ~/Downloads/waypoint /usr/local/bin
```

You can validate the installation by running `waypoint`:

```
$ waypoint
Usage: waypoint [-version] [-help] [-autocomplete-(un)install] <command> [args]

Common commands:
    release      Release a deployment.
    up           Perform the build, deploy, and release steps for the app.
    build        Build a new versioned artifact from source.
...
```

## Create Kubernetes Secret for Server Image

-> Due to Waypoint currently being in a private beta, you need to provide
authentication details for Kubernetes to access the container image that
contains the Waypoint binary for running the server. Once public, this step will not be required.

In order to provide your Kubernetes cluster access to the Waypoint container image during
the private beta, you need to create a Kubernetes secret that contains authentication information
for the GitHub packages repository that hosts the image.

First, you need to [create a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) on GitHub.

-> Note: The Personal Access Token must have `read:packages` permissions to be able to access the Docker repository.

Then, save the token to a file named `TOKEN.txt`. We will read this token when creating the Kubernetes secret. Ensure `kubectl`
is configured to interact with the correct Kubernetes cluster, and then run the following command:

```
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry github --docker-server=docker.pkg.github.com --docker-username=GITHUBUSERNAME --docker-password="$(< TOKEN.txt)" --docker-email=GITHUBEMAIL
```

When you run Waypoint install, it defaults to using an image hosted on the GitHub Docker registry.

## Install the Waypoint Server

Install the Waypoint server to Docker for Desktop on your computer. This allows you to view the user interface, collaborate on deployments, and more.

-> Note: Currently the image for the Waypoint server is hosted in GitHub packages which does not support containerd. If you are using Kind, or K3d which uses
containerd rather than DockerD, the Waypoint server install will fail with an ImagePullBackOff error. The team is currently working on resolving this issue.

```shell
 $ waypoint install -platform=kubernetes
```

You may also install the server to a Kubernetes cluster or a [Nomad cluster](https://nomadproject.io). To learn
more about Kubernetes, see the getting started
guide for [deploying an app to Kubernetes](/docs/getting-started/k8s-example-app/install-waypoint). This walkthrough
shows you how to deploy the server and an example app to Kubernetes.

### Context

One of the functions of install is that it creates a context automatically that points to the newly
created server with authentication. This is how waypoint knows the address of the server when you run
later waypoint commands.
