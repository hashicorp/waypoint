  How to install Waypoint

# Install Waypoint

-> Review the [prerequisites walkthrough](/docs/getting-started/docker-example-app/install-prereqs) before installing
Waypoint. You will use the `Ruby` application in the examples for this walkthrough.

Waypoint uses both a client and a server to build, deploy, and release applications. This is
all available from a single binary.

<!-- Make this a partial -->

## Download the Binary

To install Waypoint, find the appropriate package on [the releases site](https://go.hashi.co/waypoint-beta-binaries)
for your system and download it as a zip archive.

After downloading Waypoint, unzip the package. Waypoint runs as a single binary named `waypoint`. Any
other files in the package can be safely removed and Waypoint will still function.

To make the binary available from anywhere on your system, you can either
copy it into `/usr/local/bin` or add it to a different directory in your `PATH`. For
instructions on how to do that, see [Editing your Path](#path).

```
$ cp ~/Downloads/waypoint /usr/local/bin
```

You can validate the installation by running `waypoint`:

```
$ waypoint
Usage: waypoint [-version] [-help] [-autocomplete-(un)install] <command> [args]

Common commands:
    release      Release a deployment.
    up           Perform the build, deploy, and release steps for the app.
    build        Build a new versioned artifact from source.
...
```

## Pull the Server Image

-> Due to Waypoint currently being in a private beta, you need to authenticate
to access the container image that contains the Waypoint binary for running the
server. Once public, this step will not be required.

First, you need to authenticate Docker to access GitHub packages. This is described in detail
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-docker-for-use-with-github-packages#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token).

-> Note: The Personal Access Token must have `read:packages` permissions to be able to access the Docker repository.

Create a new Personal Access Token on GitHub, save it to a file, and then login to Docker.

```
$ cat ~/TOKEN.txt | docker login https://docker.pkg.github.com -u GITHUBUSERNAME --password-stdin
```

When you run Waypoint install, it defaults to using an image hosted on the GitHub Docker registry, and this
secret will be used to authenticate.

Now you need to download the image so that we can start a container with it:

```shell
$ docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/alpha:latest
```

## Install the Waypoint Server

In the Waypoint directory, install the Waypoint server to Docker for Desktop on your computer. This
allows you to view the user interface, collaborate on deployments, and more.

```shell
 $ waypoint install -platform=docker
```

You may also install the server to a Kubernetes cluster or a [Nomad cluster](https://nomadproject.io). To learn
more about Kubernetes, see the getting started
guide for [deploying an app to Kubernetes](/docs/getting-started/k8s-example-app/install-waypoint). This walkthrough
shows you how to deploy the server and an example app to Kubernetes.
