# Initializing Waypoint for Your App

Before you can deploy your application, you must let Waypoint know about its configuration and initialize the Waypoint Project and its plugins.

## Waypoint Configuration

The `waypoint.hcl` configuration file provides the instructions to Waypoint for how to build, deploy, and release your application. When you initialize Waypoint for your application, Waypoint will first look for a `waypoint.hcl` file in that directory. If it cannot find the configuration, Waypoint will inspect the application and create a starter `waypoint.hcl` file that you can then customize for your deployment workflow.

## Initialize Waypoint for the Example App

The remainder of this walkthrough will use the Docker and Ruby example app to show how to initialize an app and then build, deploy, and release it with Waypoint.

In the application's directory (`waypoint-examples/ruby/`), open the `waypoint.hcl` file.

```shell
$ cat waypoint.hcl
```

The output will show the following configuration in the waypoint.hcl file.

```shell
project = "example-ruby"

app "example-ruby" {
  build {
    use "pack" {}
  }

  deploy {
    use "docker" {}
  }
}
```

The `build` clause defines how Waypoint will build the app. The `pack` option tells Waypoint to use Cloud Native Buildpacks to build the application. Since the example app is authored with Ruby, a Ruby buildpack will be used.

The `deploy` clause defines how Waypoint will deploy the app. The `docker` option tells Waypoint to deploy the application to Docker.

Initialize the application with Waypoint by running the following in the Terminal.

```shell
$ waypoint init

✓ Configuration file appears valid
✓ Local mode initialized successfully
✓ Project "example-ruby" and all apps are registered with the server.
✓ Plugins loaded and configured successfully
✓ Authentication requirements appear satisfied.

Project initialized!
You may now call 'waypoint up' to deploy your project or
commands such as 'waypoint build' to perform steps individually.
```
