# Initializing Waypoint for Your App

Before you can deploy your application, you must let Waypoint know about its configuration and intialize the
Waypoint Project and plugins.

## Waypoint Configuration

The `waypoint.hcl` configuration file provides the instructions to Waypoint for how to build, deploy, and release your application. When you initialize Waypoint for your application, Waypoint will first look for a `waypoint.hcl` file in that directory. If it cannot find the configuration, Waypoint will inspect the application and create a starter `waypoint.hcl` file that you can then customize for your deployment workflow.

**Todo:** Add link here for waypoint.hcl snippets/config

## Initialize Waypoint for the Example App

The remainder of this walkthrough will use an [example application](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples/tree/master/ruby) to show how to initialize an app and then build, deploy, and release it with Waypoint.

This example app is written in Ruby and [includes a `waypoint.hcl` file](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples/blob/master/ruby/waypoint.hcl) that uses Docker to deploy the application.

```shell
project = "example-ruby"

app "example-ruby" {
  build {
    use "pack" {}
  }

  deploy {
    use "docker" {}
  }
}
```

The `build` clause defines how Waypoint will build the app. The `pack` option tells Waypoint to use Cloud Native Buildpacks to build the application. Since the example app is authored with Ruby, a Ruby buildpack will be used.

The `deploy` clause defines how Waypoint will deploy the app. The `docker` option tells Waypoint to deploy the application to Docker.

Initalize the application with Waypoint by running the following in the Terminal. You'll be entered the previously
cloned waypoint-examples repo.

```bash
$ cd waypoint-examples/ruby
$ waypoint init

✓ Configuration file appears valid
✓ Local mode initialized successfully
✓ Project "example-ruby" and all apps are registered with the server.
✓ Plugins loaded and configured successfully
✓ Authentication requirements appear satisfied.

Project initialized!
You may now call 'waypoint up' to deploy your project or
commands such as 'waypoint build' to perform steps individually.
```
