# Update and Redeploy the App

One of the most powerful workflows that Waypoint enables is the ability to continuously iterate and redeploy changes to you applications
in a consistent way. Let's demonstrate this by updating a few of the values within the application.

Using your favorite development editor, edit the `app/views/welcome/index.erb` file within the `ruby` directory.

In the `p` block below the `H1`, update the text to whatever you like and save the file.

```shell
...
    <h1>Welcome to Waypoint: <%= @host %></h1>
    <p> <!-- Edit the text in this block -->
      Congrats on deploying a ruby app using Waypoint. From here you can edit this project and continue to use it to develop your app, if you so wish.
    </p>
...
```

Back in the Terminal, redeploy the application with your new and improved text.

```shell
$ waypoint up
```

Waypoint has now deployed a new version of your application to Docker.

You will notice that the Deployment URL for this second deployment is different from what was created for the first deployment. Waypoint generates unique URLs for each deployment, which means that you can access each deployment by using their unique deployment URLs. This is typically used to preview a deployment before releasing it.

Now, open the new Deployment URL and verify that you see your modified text in the app. Congrats!

-> For Docker deployments currently, both deploys will be active for the non-Deployment specific URL. As such, accessing that URL will return requests from both deployments.
