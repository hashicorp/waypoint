# Getting Started with Waypoint

## Deploy Your First App with Waypoint and Docker

To help introduce you to Waypoint, we will use Docker locally to deploy a simple application. This walkthrough will teach you the basic components of Waypoint using a simple setup with minimal dependencies.

After you complete this guide, you will be ready to start using additional Waypoint plugins to deploy to more complex platforms, such as Kubernetes.
