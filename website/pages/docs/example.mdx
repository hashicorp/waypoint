# Example Page

This is an example of a typical documentation page. Below are demos of various markdown features that are available to docs authors.

### Code Blocks

```shell-session
$ echo 'shell example'
```

```hcl
# These control access to the key/value store.
key_prefix "" {
  policy = "read"
}
```

### Includes

@include 'example.mdx'

### Anchor Links ((#anchors))

- the following syntax can be used for anchor link aliases: ((#foo))
- `foo` ((#bar)) - lists that begin with inline code get anchor links
- normal list items do not though
