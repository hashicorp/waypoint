# Additional Runners

The `waypoint install` command installs and manages a single Waypoint runner.
Waypoint supports any number of additional runners. Additional runners must
be run manually today. A future version of Waypoint will introduce more
automated management for additional runners.

## Manually Running a Runner

The instructions below are only if you're installing additional runners
manually. `waypoint install` automatically installs a single runner and
you don't need to manually add any additional runners until the load
requires it.

To run a runner, use the `waypoint runner agent` command:

```shell-session
$ WAYPOINT_SERVER_ADDR=<server addr> \
  WAYPOINT_SERVER_TLS=true \
  WAYPOINT_SERVER_TOKEN=<auth token> \
  waypoint runner agent


» Runner configuration:
  Server address: waypoint.example.com:9701

» Runner logs:

...
```

The environment variables specify how to connect to the server:

- `WAYPOINT_SERVER_ADDR` should be the address to the Waypoint server
  that the runner can reach. The port should be for the gRPC API, and
  is typically 9701.

- `WAYPOINT_SERVER_TLS` should be set to a truthy value (e.g. "1") if
  the server is listening on TLS.

- `WAYPOINT_SERVER_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY` should be set to a truthy value
  (e.g. "1") if the TLS cert is invalid and can be safely ignored,
  such as in a development environment.

- `WAYPOINT_SERVER_TOKEN` should be an [auth token](/docs/server/auth)
  the runner can use to communicate to the server. You can generate a new
  auth token using `waypoint token new`.

If the runner process remains running and doesn't show any errors, the
runner is now registered with the server and can now be used.
