# Additional Runners

The `waypoint install` command installs and manages a single Waypoint runner.
Waypoint supports any number of additional runners. Additional runners must
be run manually today. A future version of Waypoint will introduce more
automated management for additional runners.

## Installing a Runner

Waypoint supports deploying a runner to multiple platforms with one command.
Depending on the platform, different configurations may be provided to control
various aspects of the runner deployed in the given platform. By default, the
server will adopt the runner and create a new runner profile for it after it
reports to the server.

To install a runner, use the `waypoint runner install` command. Below is an
example of using that command to install a Waypoint runner to Docker:

```shell-session
waypoint runner install -platform=docker -docker-runner-network=waypoint -server-addr=waypoint-server:9701 -server-cookie=abc123
✓ Connecting to: waypoint-server:9701
✓ Runner 01G5F2R0EKY0J8WW4W8HRGZVN1 installed successfully
✓ Runner profile docker-01G5F2R0EKY0J8WW4W8HRGZVN1 created successfully.
✓ Waypoint runner installed and started!
✓ Runner detected by server
✓ Runner 01G5F2R0EKY0J8WW4W8HRGZVN1 adopted successfully.
```

### Officially Supported Runner Platforms

Currently, Waypoint supports installing runners on the following platforms:

- Kubernetes
- Nomad
- Amazon ECS
- Docker

## Manually Running a Runner

The instructions below are only if you're installing additional runners
manually. `waypoint install` automatically installs a single runner and
you don't need to manually add any additional runners until the load
requires it.

To run a runner, use the `waypoint runner agent` command:

```shell-session
$ WAYPOINT_SERVER_ADDR=<server addr> \
  WAYPOINT_SERVER_TLS=true \
  WAYPOINT_SERVER_TOKEN=<auth token> \
  waypoint runner agent


» Runner configuration:
  Server address: waypoint.example.com:9701

» Runner logs:

...
```

The environment variables specify how to connect to the server:

- `WAYPOINT_SERVER_ADDR` should be the address to the Waypoint server
  that the runner can reach. The port should be for the gRPC API, and
  is typically 9701.

- `WAYPOINT_SERVER_TLS` should be set to a truthy value (e.g. "1") if
  the server is listening on TLS.

- `WAYPOINT_SERVER_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY` should be set to a truthy value
  (e.g. "1") if the TLS cert is invalid and can be safely ignored,
  such as in a development environment.

- `WAYPOINT_SERVER_TOKEN` should be an [auth token](/docs/server/auth)
  the runner can use to communicate to the server. You can generate a new
  auth token using `waypoint user token`.

If the runner process remains running and doesn't show any errors, the
runner is now registered with the server and can now be used.
