# Runner profiles

With runner profiles, Waypoint's remote runners can be configured to spawn new ephemeral runner instances (i.e. on-demand runners)
to perform operations like building and deploying apps. Runner profiles describe the configuration and settings
necessary to create an on-demand runner. Profiles can be used globally, or by specific projects.

## Viewing runner profiles

Waypoint installations performed on Kubernetes and ECS with the `waypoint install` command come with a default
runner profile already configured. You can view runner profiles with the `waypoint runner profile list` command:

```shell-session
$ waypoint runner profile list

     NAME    | PLUGIN TYPE |           OCI URL             | DEFAULT
-------------+-------------+-------------------------------+----------
  kubernetes | kubernetes  | hashicorp/waypoint-odr:latest | yes
```

If a default runner profile is configured for a given plugin, Waypoint will use that profile to create a new on-demand
runner for each operation on the platform for that plugin. For the majority of users, this default runner profile should
be sufficient.

You can also closely inspect a runner profile by name with the `waypoint runner profile inspect` command:

```shell-session
# waypoint runner profile inspect kubernetes
» Runner profile:
                   Name: kubernetes
                     ID: 01FHZH1T53SR7V68JGZ52BKSAK
                Default: true
                OCI URL: hashicorp/waypoint-odr:latest
            Plugin Type: kubernetes
  Environment Variables: map[]

» Additional Plugin Configuration:

{
	"service_account": "waypoint-runner"
}

$ waypoint runner profile list
Runner profiles
     NAME    | PLUGIN TYPE |            OCI URL            | DEFAULT
-------------+-------------+-------------------------------+----------
  kubernetes | kubernetes  | hashicorp/waypoint-odr:latest | yes
  ecs        | aws-ecs     | hashicorp/waypoint-odr:latest |
```

## Modifying runner profiles

It may be necessary to change the config (environment variables or files) delivered to on-demand runners.
The best way is to add config to every runner and profile with the `waypoint config -runner`, detailed [here](/docs/runner/config).

### Static environment variables

If you need environment variables that are scoped to a specific runner profile, rather than every runner, you can use
the `-env-vars` flag of `waypoint runner profile set`, i.e.:

```shell-session
$ waypoint runner profile set -name=kubernetes -env-vars="MODE=WAYPOINT_ODR" -env-vars="FOO=BAR" -plugin-type=kubernetes
```

This can be useful to configure the behavior of a custom runner image with multiple modes of operation, for example.

### OCI-URL

It may be necessary to change the runner profile OCI Url. This can be used to upgrade or downgrade the version of the
ODR image, or switch to a custom image built from hashicorp/waypoint-odr that contains custom tools or behavior.

Below is an example of switching the odr image to a prerelease alpha version of Waypoint:

```shell-session
$ waypoint runner profile set -name=kubernetes -oci-url=ghcr.io/hashicorp/waypoint/alpha-odr:latest -plugin-type=kubernetes
```

### The Default Profile

The default runner profile for any given plugin will be used to create on-demand runners for each operation on that plugin.
The default profile can be changed with the `waypoint runner profile set` command by setting `-default=false` on the
existing default profile, and `-default=true` on the new profile. If multiple profiles are set as the default,
Waypoint will choose one at random for each operation.

### Using plugin-config

Waypoint on-demand runners are backed by the `Task` plugin type, which provides an interface for launching short-lived
container-based instances and is implemented by the plugins for multiple platforms. To see the task config options for
your platform of interest, see [plugin docs](/plugins). For example, the Kubernetes task plugin docs are located
[here](/plugins/kubernetes#kubernetes-task).

The `-plugin-config` flag lets you modify the way the plugin of interest launches tasks. For example, to modify the
Kubernetes default runner profile to use a different Kubernetes service account for launching apps, create an hcl
file with your new plugin config, for example the following at `./k8s-runner-profile-plugin-config.hcl`:

```hcl
service_account=my-custom-service-account
```

And then apply it to your plugin with `waypoint runner profile set`:

```
$ waypoint runner profile set -name=kubernetes -plugin-type=kubernetes -plugin-config=./k8s-runner-profile-plugin-config.hcl
```

### Adding a new runner profile

New runner profiles can be added with the `waypoint profile set` command, using a `-name` that doesn't already exist.
Here's an example of creating a runner profile for aws-ecs:

Sample task plugin (at `./aws-ecs-plugin-config.hcl`)

```hcl
cluster = waypoint
execution_role_name = waypoint-server-execution-role
log_group = waypoint-runner-logs
odr_cpu = 512
odr_memory = 2048
region = "us-east-1"
security_group_id = "sg-087EXAMPLE62b25e6"
subnets = "subnet-01exmplc,subnet-fbexmpl3,subnet-acexmpl7,subnet-9aexmpl0"
task_role_name = waypoint-runner
```

```shell-session
waypoint runner profile set -name=ecs -plugin-type=aws-ecs -plugin-config=./aws-ecs-plugin-config.hcl
```

This can either be set as the default plugin, or be used for specific projects. Note that to use this profile,
the Waypoint remote runner will need permission and credentials to create ECS tasks in the desired cluster.

## Using Profiles for Projects

Projects can be configured to use specific runner profiles, rather than the default. To force a particular project
to build using an on-demand runner on ECS, for example, add a new runner profile as described
[above](/docs/runner/profiles#adding-a-new-runner-profile), and then use `waypoint project apply` to set the `-runner-profile`:

```shell-session
$ waypoint project apply -runner-profile=ecs <your-project-name>
```
