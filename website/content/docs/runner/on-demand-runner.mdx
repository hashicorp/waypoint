  A brief overview about on-demand runners and their role in Waypoint.

# On-Demand Runners

On-demand runners allow a single Waypoint installation to scale very high by
leveraging the defined platform to spawn resources to execute Waypoint jobs
remotely. Through on-demand runner profiles and runner targeting, Waypoint can
even utilize resources from other platforms that Waypoint has access to. For
example, a local Kubernetes server install could be configured to use Amazon ECS
to execute jobs.

## Job Assignment

When a job is submitted to the server, if on-demand runners are enabled, it
will spawn an on-demand runner and the job is placed in a holding set. This is
the same mechanism we use today for automatic CLI runners. When the on-demand
runner starts, it will execute the normal Waypoint runner code and connect back
to the server. On connection, the server will see the job in the holding set
and send it immediately to the new runner.

The flow of information about the job will use the existing grpc runner APIs so
all the input and output remain the same as today.

Upon finishing the job, the on-demand runner will exit and the platform it runs
on will reclaim its resources.

### Launching Tasks to Execute Jobs

When Waypoint goes to launch an on-demand runner task, it will generate three
jobs:

- `StartJob`
- `TaskJob`
- `StopJob`

The start job is responsible for scheduling a resource in the platform to execute
the assigned job. Once that resource exists, it will be a `TaskJob` that is
responsible for actually running the assigned job. Once it's complete, the task
plugin system will launch a stop job to end the launched platform resource.

## On-Demand Runner Profiles

Users can configure Waypoint server to launch on-demand runners with specific
configurations. These configurations are set through on-demand runner profiles.
See [runner profiles](/docs/runner/profiles) for more information.

## OCI/Docker Image

By default, the server will launch on-demand runners using the same OCI image
it was configured with. The on-demand configuration will also accept a specific
OCI image url to use instead. This allows operators the ability to prepackage
any Waypoint plugins into the image and use them in their configuration.

The official on-demand runner container image is built very similar to Waypoint
server, with some additional packages such as `Kaniko` for doing in-container
builds for jobs like the `Build operation`.

Users can configure Waypoint server to launch on-demand runners with a custom
built on-demand runner image. This image name must be set via the on-demand
runner profile.

## Official Waypoint Supported Task Plugin Platforms

When you use the `waypoint server install` command, we automatically set up a
default On-Demand runner profile for you to use with Waypoint Server. Like our
server install platform support, we also currently support these platforms
for launching on-demand runner tasks.

- `Kubernetes`
- `HashiCorp/Nomad`
- `AWS/ECS`
- `Docker`

## Task Plugin

Launching on-demand runners can be developed with the Task plugin. If there
is a platform that you wish to support while using Waypoint, we provide a
plugin system, similar to our build/deploy/release plugins, that lets you
define your own configuration for launching tasks on your platform of choice.

Plugins expect to fulfill the SDK interface with the following functions:

- `StartTask`
- `StopTask`

These functions are what will launch and stop the spawned resource with the
task launcher.

Task plugins also can accept `TaskLauncherConfig` configuration which users can
configure through an [on-demand runner profile](/docs/runner/profiles).

## Task Introspection

In Waypoint 0.9.0, we will introduce the CLI command `waypoint task`. This command
currently gives users more introspection into the task launcher system and
what Waypoint is doing with remote-enabled projects. The simplest benefit
to this command is listing all known tasks in the system:

```shell
$ waypoint task list

» Waypoint On-Demand Runner Tasks

```

This will display a list of all known Tasks in Waypoint server. It will show
the current state of the task as well.

```shell
$ waypoint task inspect 01G1RYP6JFSEAQVE2SQX38Q19D
