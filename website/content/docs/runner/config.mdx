  Waypoint utilizes "runners" to execute Waypoint operations remotely. Runners can be configured through the `waypoint config` command or through environment variables

# Runner Configuration

Runners may require additional configuration such as cloud credentials,
Docker registry credentials, etc. There are two ways to set these credentials
today: via environment variables set with `waypoint config` or
[manually running the runner](/docs/runner/run-manual) and setting up the
environment.

## Environment Variables

You can set environment variables using [`waypoint config`](/commands/config-set)
with the `-runner` flag:

```shell-session
$ waypoint config set -runner AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=abcd AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=1234
```

This will expose these environment variables on every runner (including
the CLI when it runs operations locally). To unset any variables, assign it to
an empty value. You may view the set of runner configuration values using
`waypoint config get`:

```shell-session
$ waypoint config get -runner
```

~> **Security note:** These configuration values are stored as plaintext in the
Waypoint server. If you do not want to store any secrets on the Waypoint server,
you must set the environment variables manually when
[manually running the runner](/docs/runner/run-manual).

-> **Dynamic values:** Runners do not support [dynamic configuration values](/docs/app-config/dynamic)
yet. We plan to expose this in a future version.
