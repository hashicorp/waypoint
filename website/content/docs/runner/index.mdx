# Waypoint Runners

Waypoint utilizes "runners" to execute operations. Every build, deploy, or release operation happens on
a Waypoint runner. Waypoint has three kinds of runners:

### CLI Runner

When you trigger an action with the CLI, i.e. by running `waypoint deploy`, the CLI acts as a runner
capable of performing your operation. If your deployment needs AWS credentials, or a valid kubectl context,
it can access the credentials on the developer workstation that it's running on.

If you only use Waypoint from the CLI, this is the only kind of runner that is used.

### Remote Runner

Not every operation in Waypoint needs to happen in response to a CLI invocation from a privileged workstation.
Waypoint can trigger deployments from the UI or automatically based on git changes, or automatically
poll the status of applications in the background. In these cases, Waypoint needs a "remote runner", a long-lived
runner that is always available to run these operations.

Waypoint automatically installs a single remote runner by default when the Waypoint
server is installed with [`waypoint install`](/commands/install).

### On-demand runners

While the remote runner is capable of performing operations on its own, it also supports plugins
to spawn on-demand runners for a given platform. These on-demand runners are ephemeral container instances that perform one operation before exiting. These on-demand runners can
perform container builds without any privileged access, offer more isolation between operations, and allow Waypoint
to scale further.

On-demand runners: see [on-demand runners](/docs/runner/on-demand-runner) for more information.

## Runner Targeting

Runner targeting allows users to configure Waypoint to target specific runners to execute operations for an application. A runner `profile` can be specified
in the `runner` stanza in the `waypoint.hcl` file. The `runner profile` can be configured to use a specific static runner,
or multiple, based on labels.

### Runner Targeting Example

Runners can have labels applied to them with the `-label` flag provided alongside the `waypoint runner agent` command.

```terminal
$ waypoint runner agent -label=org=hashicorp -label=env=dev
```

After the runner is started up, it can be adopted by the server for use in remote operations. With `waypoint runner list`,
you can see the full list of available runners & their labels.

```shell-session
% waypoint runner list
              ID             |  STATE   |  KIND  |         LABELS         | LAST REGISTERED
-----------------------------+----------+--------+------------------------+------------------
  01G4N53X8DCJR3DJ9R56D6KZKH | pending  | remote | env:dev org:hashicorp  |

% waypoint runner adopt 01G4N53X8DCJR3DJ9R56D6KZKH
Runner "01G4N53X8DCJR3DJ9R56D6KZKH" adopted.

% waypoint runner list
              ID             |  STATE   |  KIND  |         LABELS         | LAST REGISTERED
-----------------------------+----------+--------+------------------------+------------------
  01G4N53X8DCJR3DJ9R56D6KZKH | adopted  | remote | env:dev org:hashicorp  |
```

With a created runner that has labels applied, you can then create a runner profile to target that runner (or runners).
When this runner profile is used, Waypoint will only generate on-demand runners using a runner whose labels match those
specified in the runner profile.

```terminal
% waypoint runner profile set -name=docker-hashicorp-dev -plugin-type=docker -target-runner-label=org=hashicorp -target-runner-label=env=dev
âœ“ Runner profile created
```

```shell-session
                  NAME                  | PLUGIN TYPE |               OCI URL                |              TARGET RUNNER              | DEFAULT
----------------------------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+----------
  docker-hashicorp-dev                  | docker      | hashicorp/waypoint-odr:latest        | labels: {"env":"dev","org":"hashicorp"} |
```

In the `waypoint.hcl` file, you can specify the runner profile to use with the `runner` stanza. In this example, a user
variable "org" and the built-in `workspace` variable are interpolated into the runner profile name, so that at the time
of execution of remote operations, Waypoint uses the desired runner profile.

```hcl
project = "example-nodejs"

app "example-nodejs" {
  runner {
    profile = "docker-${var.org}-${workspace.name}"
  }

  build {
    # ...
  }

  deploy {
    # ...
  }

  release {
    # ...
  }
}

variable "org" {
  type = string
}
```

An operation which would use the runner profile created in this example could be initiated with `waypoint build -w=dev -var=org=hashicorp -local=false`.

### Runner Targeting Advantages

The example above demonstrates basic usage of runner targeting. However, in a production environment, runner targeting
may be essential to achieving high availability. Multiple runners could be deployed with the same labels, and then a
runner profile which targets runners with those labels would "round robin" between the available runners. If one goes down,
as long as another with the same labels is still online, remote operations will continue to work.

Also evidenced in the example is runner targeting for multi-env operations. In the example, the workspace of the operation,
dev, is interpolated into the runner profile name dynamically at operation runtime. Additional runners & runner profiles
could be created for a "test" or "prod" environment, for example, so that at runtime a runner to deploy to the right environment
is used.

Runner targeting is also useful for workflows where you deploy to multiple clusters in a platform. For example, if you have
a runner in one Kubernetes cluster, that runner could potentially only perform remote operations within that cluster. However,
if there were a runner in multiple Kubernetes clusters, you would have the ability to deploy to any of the clusters with
Waypoint remote operations by targeting the appropriate runners in each cluster.

## Disabling Runners

Runners can be disabled if desired. With runners disabled, Waypoint executes
all operations via the local CLI (even when communicating with a remote
[server](/docs/server)).

### Unavailable Functionality

With runners disabled, certain functionality becomes unavailable:

- Remote operations
- Git polling

In addition to disabled functionality, consider that all clients must now
have proper credentials for the target platforms (such as AWS, GCP, etc.)
since without runners they must execute all operations locally.

### Disabling Runner Installation

Prior to installation, runners can be disabled by specifying the
`-runner=false` flag to the [`waypoint install`](/commands/install) command.
This will not install a runner.

To uninstall a runner that is already installed, the only option today is
to uninstall and reinstall Waypoint with a
[data snapshot and restore](/docs/server/run/maintenance#backup-restore). You
may also manually go into your platform and delete the runner, but Waypoint
can't automate this for you today.

If there is a runner which you'd no longer like your server to use for remote
operations, this runner can be "invalidated" for use by the server with the
`waypoint runner forget` command, with the ID of the runner provided.
