<Warning>

This content is part of the legacy version of Waypoint that is no longer actively maintained. For additional information on the new vision of Waypoint, check out [this blog post](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/a-new-vision-for-hcp-waypoint) and the [HCP Waypoint documentation](/hcp/docs/waypoint).

</Warning>

# Install Waypoint

Waypoint uses both a client and a server to build, deploy, and release
applications. This functionality is all available from a single binary.

Whether you use an HCP Waypoint managed server, or choose to run your own
self-managed server, you will need the Waypoint client.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Manual installation">

Get Waypoint by downloading a pre-compiled `waypoint` binary or compiling it from source.

To install Waypoint, find the [appropriate package](/waypoint/downloads/) for your system and download it as a zip archive.

After downloading Waypoint, unzip the package. Waypoint runs as a single
binary named `waypoint`. Any other files in the package can be safely removed
and Waypoint will still function.

Finally, make sure that the `waypoint` binary is available on your `PATH`. This process will differ depending on your operating system.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Mac or Linux">

Print a colon-separated list of locations in your `PATH`.

```shell-session
$ echo $PATH
```

Move the Waypoint binary to one of the listed locations. This command assumes that the binary is currently in your downloads folder and that your `PATH` includes `/usr/local/bin`, but you can customize it if your locations are different.

```shell-session
$ mv ~/Downloads/waypoint /usr/local/bin/
```

For more detail about adding binaries to your path, see [this Stack Overflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux).

[This Stack Overflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows)
contains instructions for setting the PATH on Windows through the user interface.
