<Warning>

This content is part of the legacy version of Waypoint that is no longer actively maintained. For additional information on the new vision of Waypoint, check out [this blog post](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/a-new-vision-for-hcp-waypoint) and the [HCP Waypoint documentation](/hcp/docs/waypoint).

</Warning>

# Use Waypoint with Docker

In this tutorial, you will learn how Waypoint works by deploying and running an application on your local machine with Waypoint and Docker Desktop.

<InteractiveLabCallout />

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, you will need:

- The [Waypoint CLI version 0.11.1 or later installed locally](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-docker/get-started-install)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed locally and running 
- (Optional) An [HCP Account](/hcp/docs/hcp/create-account) if you want to use HCP Waypoint

## Clone the example repository

The [example repository](https://github.com/hashicorp-education/learn-waypoint-get-started) contains application code and Waypoint configuration files for building, deploying, and releasing the application with Waypoint.

Clone the example repository.

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp-education/learn-waypoint-get-started.git
```

Navigate to the `example-app` directory.

```shell-session
$ cd docker/example-app
```

## Set up the Waypoint server

[HCP Waypoint](/hcp/docs/waypoint) is a HashiCorp-managed service that helps you to manage your application lifecycle without maintaining a Waypoint server and associated infrastructure. It allows to you automate and simplify the process of deploying your web applications into your infrastructure.

Waypoint runs as a server and a client, whether run on HCP Waypoint or locally. For this tutorial, you can choose to use HCP Waypoint for the server and your local machine for the client or run Waypoint entirely on your local machine.

Both methods create a [Waypoint context](/waypoint/commands/context-list) that contains information about the server and authentication for connecting to it from the Waypoint CLI. This is how the CLI knows the address of the server when you run other Waypoint commands.

### Set up an HCP organization and project

[Sign in to your HCP account](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in) and create an HCP organization by following the steps in the [Create an organization](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs#create-an-organization) page. Then, create an HCP project by following the steps in the [Create a project](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects#create-a-project) page.

### Enable HCP Waypoint

Click on the **Waypoint** option from the left navigation.

![HCP UI with the Waypoint option highlighted](/img/tutorials/get-started/hcp-ui-waypoint-option.jpg)

Then, click on the **Activate Waypoint** button in the top right of the page.

![HCP Waypoint UI with the Activate Waypoint button highlighted](/img/tutorials/get-started/hcp-ui-waypoint-activate.jpg)

A dialog appears to confirm that Waypoint has been activated.

![HCP Waypoint UI a dialog showing that Waypoint has been activated](/img/tutorials/get-started/hcp-ui-waypoint-activation-complete.jpg)

### Set up HCP Waypoint context

Click the **Manage** button on the top right of the page, click on the clipboard icon to copy the `waypoint context create` command, and run it in your terminal. Your Waypoint CLI can now communicate with HCP Waypoint.

![HCP Waypoint UI with the Manage button clicked and copy button highlighted](/img/tutorials/get-started/hcp-ui-waypoint-manage.jpg)

HCP Waypoint works with your local installation of the Waypoint CLI and does not require any additional runners as it uses the one that is [part of the CLI](/waypoint/docs/runner#cli-runner). Installing and connecting a [static runner](/waypoint/docs/runner#static-runner) to HCP Waypoint allows you to automate your workflow with GitOps and use [dynamic configuration sourcing](/waypoint/docs/app-config/dynamic) without requiring interaction with your CLI.

This tutorial uses only the CLI runner and does not include runner installation. You can read more about the runner installation process on the [runner install page](/waypoint/commands/runner-install).

### Install the Waypoint server

Install the Waypoint server to Docker Desktop on your local machine. The `-accept-tos` flag
confirms that you accept the terms of service for the [Waypoint URL
service](https://www.waypointproject.io/terms). There is [additional information](#waypoint-url-service) about the URL service later in the tutorial.

```shell-session
$ waypoint install -platform=docker -accept-tos

### About the server workflow

When you deploy your app with Waypoint, your local machine acts as the client and connects to the Waypoint server to initiate the workflow. The client then registers itself as a runner, allowing Waypoint to run builds on it.

When the build is complete, the Waypoint server sends the build artifacts, such as a container image, to the artifact registry of your choice. Multiple Waypoint clients can connect to a single server to deploy and release applications.

## Initialize Waypoint for the application

You must initialize and configure Waypoint for your application before beginning the build, deploy, and release workflow.

During the initialization process, Waypoint searches for a `waypoint.hcl` configuration file for the application in the current directory. This configuration file gives Waypoint instructions for how to build, deploy, and release your application. If Waypoint cannot find the configuration file when `waypoint init` is run, it will create a `waypoint.hcl` file that you can then customize for your application.

### Review the `waypoint.hcl` file

Open the `waypoint.hcl` file.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="docker/example-app/waypoint.hcl" hideClipboard>

```hcl
project = "example-nodejs"

app "example-nodejs" {
  labels = {
    "service" = "example-nodejs",
    "env"     = "dev"
  }

  build {
    use "pack" {}
  }

  deploy {
    use "docker" {}
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The `app` block defines the name of the application in Waypoint and contains the `build`, `deploy`, and `release` configuration blocks.

The `labels` block defines [labels](/waypoint/docs/lifecycle/labels) for the application. These are intended to contain information such as organizational or process data useful to the user but not directly interpreted by Waypoint.

The [`use` option](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/use) within the `build`, `deploy`, and `release` blocks specifies which plugin to use during those specific phases of the workflow.

The `build` block defines how Waypoint will [build the application](/waypoint/docs/lifecycle/build) and produce an artifact.
- Since the `use "pack"` option in this example is empty, Waypoint uses the default configuration for the [Cloud Native Buildpacks plugin](/waypoint/plugins/pack), which selects the most relevant pack to build the application.

The `deploy` block defines how Waypoint will deploy the app.
- The `use "docker"` option in this example tells Waypoint to use the Docker plugin to deploy the application to Docker with any configurations defined in the block.

### Waypoint URL service

The [Waypoint URL service](/waypoint/docs/url) is a service hosted by HashiCorp that generates publically accessible URLs for your applications on Waypoint. The URLs are connected to your application and their deployment locations so the URLs will only resolve when the deployment is running.

These preview URLs are optional and can be disabled in the [Waypoint server configuration](/waypoint/commands/server-run#url-enabled) when running a server manually with `waypoint server run`. You can also disable preview URLs on a per-app basis with the [`url` block](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/url) if the service is enabled on the server.

<CodeBlockConfig heading="Disable the URL service for a specific app" hideClipboard highlight="4-6">

```hcl
project = "example-project"

app "example-application" {
  url {
    auto_hostname = false
  }
  
  # ...
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Initialize Waypoint

Initialize Waypoint for the example application.

```shell-session
$ waypoint init
✓ Configuration file appears valid
✓ Connection to Waypoint server was successful
✓ Project "example-nodejs" and all apps are registered with the server.
✓ Project "example-nodejs" pipelines are registered with the server.

Project initialized!

You may now call 'waypoint up' to deploy your project or
commands such as 'waypoint build' to perform steps individually.
```

## Build and deploy

With the initialization complete, use the [`waypoint up` command](/waypoint/commands/up) to instruct Waypoint to build, deploy, and release your application. 

### Run `waypoint up`

Waypoint uses Cloud Native Buildpacks to [automatically detect](https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-journey/#auto-detection) the type of application and uses the applicable buildpack to create the build artifact.

Once Waypoint completes the build, it stores the artifacts in a registry. The [`registry` block](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/registry) contains the configuration for where Waypoint should store those artifacts. By default, Waypoint stores Docker artifacts locally with Docker Desktop unless the `registry` block contains additional configuration.

Start the Waypoint workflow.

```shell-session
$ waypoint up
```

Waypoint will start the process and output the following.

The deploy was successful!

The release did not provide a URL and the URL service is disabled on the
server, so no further URL information can be automatically provided. If
this is unexpected, please ensure the Waypoint server has both the URL service
enabled and advertise addresses set.
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Waypoint shows the progress of the build, deploy, and release steps in the output but does not contain deployment URLs as the [URL service](#waypoint-url-service) is disabled when using HCP Waypoint.

Find the address of the example application by checking the running Docker containers on your local machine. This command lists the Docker containers, searches for the application name, and formats the output with the local address and application port.

```shell-session
$ docker container list --format "{{ .Image }} {{ .Ports }}" | \
    grep -i example-nodejs | \
    awk -F ' ' '{print $2}' | \
    cut -d"-" -f1 | \
    awk '{print "http://"$1}'

The deploy was successful! A Waypoint deployment URL is shown below. This
can be used internally to check your deployment and is not meant for external
traffic. You can manage this hostname using "waypoint hostname."

</CodeBlockConfig>

Waypoint shows the progress of the build, deploy, and release steps in the output and creates preview URLs for your application with the URL service as part of the deployment workflow. The *Deployment URL* is unique to a specific deployment version while the *URL* points to any of the application's deployments that are still active.

Open the deployment URL in your web browser.

## Update and redeploy the app

One of the most powerful parts of Waypoint is that it allows you to quickly iterate on changes to your code and redeploy your application.

Open `index.js` in your text editor and update the deployment message. Save the file.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="docker/example-app/views/pages/index.ejs" highlight="5" hideClipboard>

```html
<section class="content">
  <div class="language-icon">
    <img src="/language.svg" alt="Node.js Icon" />
  </div>
  <h1>This Node.js app was updated and redeployed with Waypoint!</h1>
  <p>
    Try making a change to this text locally and run <code>waypoint up</code> again to see it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Read the <a href="https://waypointproject.io/docs">documentation</a> for more about Waypoint.
