This content is part of the legacy version of Waypoint that is no longer actively maintained. For additional information on the new vision of Waypoint, check out [this blog post](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/a-new-vision-for-hcp-waypoint) and the [HCP Waypoint documentation](/hcp/docs/waypoint).

# Destroy the Deployment

When you are ready to clean up, you can destroy the application in Waypoint and then uninstall the Waypoint components.

## Destroy the application

Remove your application from the cluster by running the `waypoint destroy` command. Respond `yes` when prompted to confirm the operation. This will destroy any active deployments and releases.

```shell-session
$ waypoint destroy
Do you really want to destroy all resources for this app?
Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve: yes
```

Waypoint will start the process and output the following.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
» Performing operation locally

» Destroying releases for application 'example-nodejs'...
✓ Running release destroy v2
✓ Running release destroy v1

» Destroying deployments for application 'example-nodejs'...
✓ Running deployment destroy v2
✓ Deleting container: af1753fbcb68a7cfa9d61a14bc4427b32ae13a3ba7b7040d648898e9a8300f9e
