This content is part of the legacy version of Waypoint that is no longer actively maintained. For additional information on the new vision of Waypoint, check out [this blog post](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/a-new-vision-for-hcp-waypoint) and the [HCP Waypoint documentation](/hcp/docs/waypoint).

# Destroy the Deployment from Kubernetes

When you are ready to clean up, you can destroy the application in Waypoint and uninstall any Waypoint components from the cluster before destroying the cluster itself.

## Destroy the application

Remove your application from the cluster by running the `destroy` command. Respond `yes` when prompted to confirm the operation. This will destroy any active deployments and releases.

```shell-session
$ waypoint destroy
Do you really want to destroy all resources for this app? Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve: yes
```

Waypoint will start the process and output the following.

```shell-session
» Destroying releases for application 'kubernetes-nodejs-web'...
✓ Running release destroy v2
✓ Kubernetes client connected to https://885AB95F22BA8B45D6EBBE3A4A78C48E.sk1.us-east-2.eks.amazonaws.com with namespace default
✓ Service deleted

» Performing operation locally
✓ Running release destroy v1
✓ Kubernetes client connected to https://885AB95F22BA8B45D6EBBE3A4A78C48E.sk1.us-east-2.eks.amazonaws.com with namespace default
✓ Service deleted

» Destroying deployments for application 'kubernetes-nodejs-web'...
✓ Running deployment destroy v2
✓ Kubernetes client connected to https://885AB95F22BA8B45D6EBBE3A4A78C48E.sk1.us-east-2.eks.amazonaws.com with namespace default
✓ Deployment deleted
✓ Running deployment destroy v1
✓ Kubernetes client connected to https://885AB95F22BA8B45D6EBBE3A4A78C48E.sk1.us-east-2.eks.amazonaws.com with namespace default
✓ Deployment deleted
Destroy successful!
```

## Uninstall Waypoint

### Deactivate HCP Waypoint

Deactivating HCP Waypoint is an optional step that disables Waypoint for your HCP project. This will not delete any runners or images that have been pushed to a registry.

Click the **Manage** button on the top right of the page, and then click on the **Deactivate Waypoint** option.
