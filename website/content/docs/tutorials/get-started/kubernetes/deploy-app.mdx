# Deploy an Application to Kubernetes

In this tutorial, you will learn how Waypoint works by deploying and running an application on Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, you will need:

- The [Waypoint CLI version 0.11.1 or later installed locally](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-kubernetes/get-started-install)
- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) installed locally
- A free [DockerHub personal account](https://docs.docker.com/docker-id/) for storing and accessing images
- (Optional) An [HCP Account](/hcp/docs/hcp/create-account) if you want to use HCP Waypoint

You will create a Kubernetes cluster in this tutorial and depending on where you want to run it, you'll also need one of the following:
- Docker Desktop installed to use [Kubernetes on Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/)
- An AWS account and [Terraform installed](/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) if you want to run Waypoint on a Kubernetes cluster on AWS
- A GCP account, the [`gcloud` CLI tool installed](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install), and [Terraform installed](/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) if you want to run Waypoint on a Kubernetes cluster on GCP

## Clone the example repository

The [example repository](https://github.com/hashicorp-education/learn-waypoint-get-started) contains application code and Waypoint configuration files for building, deploying, and releasing the application with Waypoint.

Clone the example repository.

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp-education/learn-waypoint-get-started.git
```

Navigate to the `example-app` directory.

```shell-session
$ cd kubernetes/example-app
```

## Set up DockerHub configuration

When running Waypoint on non-local infrastructure, an external image repository is necessary for storing and retrieving built images. In this tutorial, you will use DockerHub as an external image repository but other ones work as long as you properly configure authentication through the [`auth` configuration](/waypoint/integrations/hashicorp/docker/latest/components/registry/docker-registry#parameters.auth) of the registry block in the Docker plugin.

To access DockerHub for pushing and pulling images, Waypoint requires authentication credentials. It supports credential definitions in the `waypoint.hcl` file and ["out of band" authentication](/waypoint/docs/lifecycle/build#out-of-band-authentication) by reading configurations set locally by a `docker login` either through the Docker CLI or Docker Desktop. In this tutorial, you will be providing DockerHub token credentials through environment variables.

Navigate to DockerHub, log in, and create an access token by visiting the [security settings page](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security) and clicking the **New Access Token** button. Give the token a description, select the **Read, Write, Delete** permission option from the dropdown, and click the **Generate** button.

![Create an access token on DockerHub](/img/tutorials/hcp-runners/dockerhub-token-creation.jpg)

Copy the token value and export it as an environment variable.

```shell-session
$ export REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<YOUR_TOKEN>
```

Then, export your DockerHub username.

```shell-session
$ export REGISTRY_USERNAME=<YOUR_USERNAME>
```

## Create a Kubernetes environment

Waypoint can run on any Kubernetes cluster including locally with Docker Desktop and major cloud provider distributions like Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) and Google GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine).

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Docker Desktop" group="Docker">

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) has a built-in feature for running a local Kubernetes cluster.

To enable Kubernetes on your local machine, open the Docker Desktop application, navigate to the Preferences screen, click on the **Kubernetes** option in the left navigation, check the **Enable Kubernetes** check box, and click the **Apply & Restart** button.

![Docker Desktop application on MacOS](/img/tutorials/get-started/docker_desktop_enable_kubernetes_macos.jpg)

![Docker Desktop application on Windows](/img/tutorials/get-started/docker_desktop_enable_kubernetes_windows.jpg)

After a few moments, Docker Desktop will restart with an active Kubernetes cluster. The `kubectl` context will be set as part of the process.

Verify connectivity and that the correct context is set.

```shell-session
$  kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443
CoreDNS is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

## Set up Waypoint

[HCP Waypoint](/hcp/docs/waypoint) is a HashiCorp-managed service that helps you to manage your application lifecycle without maintaining a Waypoint server and associated infrastructure. It allows to you automate and simplify the process of deploying your web applications into your infrastructure.

Waypoint runs as a server and a client, whether run on HCP Waypoint or locally. For this tutorial, you can choose to use HCP Waypoint for the server and your Kubernetes cluster for the client or run Waypoint entirely on your cluster.

Both methods create a [Waypoint context](/waypoint/commands/context-list) that contains information about the server and authentication for connecting to it from the Waypoint CLI. This is how the CLI knows the address of the server when you run other Waypoint commands.

<Tip>

Since Waypoint can run on any Kubernetes cluster, you can use the same install command regardless of whether your cluster is on AWS, GCP, Docker Desktop, or elsewhere. However, note that some of the output from the commands in this tutorial may differ from yours depending on the location of your cluster.

</Tip>

<Tabs>

### Set up an HCP organization and project

[Sign in to your HCP account](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in) and create an HCP organization by following the steps in the [Create an organization](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs#create-an-organization) page. Then, create an HCP project by following the steps in the [Create a project](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects#create-a-project) page.

### Enable HCP Waypoint

Click on the **Waypoint** option from the left navigation.

![HCP UI with the Waypoint option highlighted](/img/tutorials/get-started/hcp-ui-waypoint-option.jpg)

Then, click on the **Activate Waypoint** button in the top right of the page.

![HCP Waypoint UI with the Activate Waypoint button highlighted](/img/tutorials/get-started/hcp-ui-waypoint-activate.jpg)

A dialog appears to confirm that Waypoint has been activated.

![HCP Waypoint UI a dialog showing that Waypoint has been activated](/img/tutorials/get-started/hcp-ui-waypoint-activation-complete.jpg)

### Set up HCP Waypoint context

Click the **Manage** button on the top right of the page, click on the clipboard icon to copy the `waypoint context create` command, and run it in your terminal. Your Waypoint CLI can now communicate with HCP Waypoint.

![HCP Waypoint UI with the Manage button clicked and copy button highlighted](/img/tutorials/get-started/hcp-ui-waypoint-manage.jpg)

HCP Waypoint works with your local installation of the Waypoint CLI and does not require any additional runners as it uses the one that is [part of the CLI](/waypoint/docs/runner#cli-runner). Installing and connecting a [static runner](/waypoint/docs/runner#static-runner) to HCP Waypoint allows you to automate your workflow with GitOps and use [dynamic configuration sourcing](/waypoint/docs/app-config/dynamic) without requiring interaction with your CLI.

This tutorial uses only the CLI runner and does not include runner installation. You can read more about the runner installation process on the [runner install page](/waypoint/commands/runner-install).

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Kubernetes only" group="k8s">

### Install Waypoint

Install the server and client runner components into the cluster. The `-accept-tos` flag confirms that you accept the [terms of service](https://www.waypointproject.io/terms) for the Waypoint URL service. There is [additional information](#waypoint-url-service) about the URL service later in the tutorial.

```shell-session
$ waypoint install --platform=kubernetes -accept-tos
✓ Service "waypoint" is ready
✓ Server bootstrap complete!
✓ Waypoint server installed with Helm!
✓ Configured server connection
✓ Successfully connected to Waypoint server in Kubernetes!
✓ Server installed and configured!
✓ Runner "static" installed
✓ Waypoint runner installed with Helm!
✓ Runner "static" adopted successfully.
Waypoint server successfully installed and configured!

The CLI has been configured to connect to the server automatically. This
connection information is saved in the CLI context named "install-1679676263".
Use the "waypoint context" CLI to manage CLI contexts.

The server has been configured to advertise the following address for
entrypoint communications. This must be a reachable address for all your
deployments. If this is incorrect, manually set it using the CLI command
"waypoint server config-set".

To launch and authenticate into the Web UI, run:
waypoint ui -authenticate

Advertise Address: waypoint-server:9701
Web UI Address: https://localhost:9702
```

Verify the installation by listing the cluster resources. The install process creates several components that make up the Waypoint application including Pods and StatefulSets for the server and runner client, services for the server and UI, and bootstrapping resources that are part of the installation process.

```shell-session
$ kubectl get all

## Initialize Waypoint for the Application

You must initialize and configure Waypoint for your application before beginning the build, deploy, and release workflow.

During the initialization process, Waypoint searches for a `waypoint.hcl` configuration file for the application in the current directory. This configuration file gives Waypoint instructions for how to build, deploy, and release your application. If Waypoint cannot find the configuration file when `waypoint init` is run, it will create a `waypoint.hcl` file that you can then customize for your application.

### Review the `waypoint.hcl` file

Open the `waypoint.hcl` file.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="kubernetes/example-app/waypoint.hcl" hideClipboard>

```hcl
variable "registry_username" {
  type = string
  default = ""
  env = ["REGISTRY_USERNAME"]
}

variable "registry_password" {
  type = string
  sensitive = true
  default = ""
  env = ["REGISTRY_PASSWORD"]
}

project = "kubernetes-nodejs"

app "kubernetes-nodejs-web" {
  labels = {
    "service" = "kubernetes-nodejs-web",
    "env"     = "dev"
  }

  build {
    use "pack" {}
    registry {
       use "docker" {
        image = "${var.registry_username}/kubernetes-nodejs-web"
        tag   = "1"
        local = false
        auth {
          username = var.registry_username
          password = var.registry_password
        }
      }
    }
  }

  deploy {
    use "kubernetes" {
      probe_path = "/"
    }
  }

  release {
    use "kubernetes" {
      // Sets up a load balancer to access released application
      load_balancer = true
      port          = 3000
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The `variable` blocks define the Docker registry username and password environment variables set earlier.

The `app` block defines the name of the application in Waypoint and contains the `build`, `deploy`, and `release` configuration blocks.

The `labels` block defines [labels](/waypoint/docs/lifecycle/labels) for the application. These are intended to contain information such as organizational or process data useful to the user but not directly interpreted by Waypoint.

The [`use` option](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/use) within the `build`, `deploy`, and `release` blocks specifies which plugin to use during those specific phases of the workflow.

The `build` block defines how Waypoint will [build the application](/waypoint/docs/lifecycle/build) and produce an artifact.
- Since the `use "pack"` option in this example is empty, Waypoint uses the default configuration for the [Cloud Native Buildpacks plugin](/waypoint/plugins/pack), which selects the most relevant pack to build the application.
- The `registry` option specifies image registry information. In this example, the image contains the username for DockerHub and an `auth` block with credentials for pushing to that registry. The [`image` attribute must include the fully qualified name](/waypoint/integrations/hashicorp/docker/latest/components/registry/docker-registry#parameters.image) unless you are using DockerHub.

The `deploy` block defines how Waypoint will deploy the application.
- In this example, the [`probe_path` attribute](/waypoint/integrations/hashicorp/docker/latest/components/registry/docker-registry#parameters.probe_path) of the Kubernetes plugin instructs Waypoint to run a health check on the application at the path `/`.

The `release` block defines how Waypoint releases the application. In this example, the release block uses the Kubernetes plugin and creates a load balancer that listens on port `3000`.

### Waypoint URL service

The [Waypoint URL service](/waypoint/docs/url) is a service hosted by HashiCorp that generates publically accessible URLs for your applications on Waypoint. The URLs are connected to your application and their deployment locations so the URLs will only resolve when the deployment is running.

These preview URLs are optional and can be disabled in the [Waypoint server configuration](/waypoint/commands/server-run#url-enabled) when running a server manually with `waypoint server run`. You can also disable preview URLs on a per-app basis with the [`url` block](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/url) if the service is enabled on the server.

<CodeBlockConfig heading="Disable the URL service for a specific app" hideClipboard highlight="4-6">

```hcl
project = "example-project"

app "example-application" {
  url {
    auto_hostname = false
  }
  
  # ...
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Initialize Waypoint

Initialize Waypoint for the example application.

```shell-session
$ waypoint init
✓ Configuration file appears valid
✓ Connection to Waypoint server was successful
✓ Project "kubernetes-nodejs" and all apps are registered with the server.
✓ Project "kubernetes-nodejs" pipelines are registered with the server.

Project initialized!

You may now call 'waypoint up' to deploy your project or
commands such as 'waypoint build' to perform steps individually.
```

## Build and Deploy

With the initialization complete, use the [`waypoint up` command](/waypoint/commands/up) to instruct Waypoint to build, deploy, and release your application. 

### Run `waypoint up`

Waypoint uses Cloud Native Buildpacks to [automatically detect](https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-journey/#auto-detection) the type of application and uses the applicable buildpack to create the build artifact.

Once Waypoint completes the build, it stores the artifacts in a registry. The [`registry` block](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/registry) contains the configuration for where Waypoint should store those artifacts. By default, Waypoint stores Docker artifacts locally with Docker Desktop unless the `registry` block contains additional configuration.

Start the Waypoint workflow.

```shell-session
$ waypoint up
```

Waypoint will start the process and output the following.

## Update and Redeploy the App

One of the most powerful parts of Waypoint is that it allows you to quickly iterate on and redeploy changes to your application.

Open `index.ejs` in your text editor and update the deployment message in the `<h1>` tag. Save the file.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="kubernetes/example-app/views/pages/index.ejs" highlight="5" hideClipboard>

```html
<section class="content">
  <div class="language-icon">
    <img src="/language.svg" alt="Node.js Icon" />
  </div>
  <h1>This Node.js app was updated and redeployed with Waypoint!</h1>
  <p>
    Try making a change to this text locally and run <code>waypoint up</code> again to see it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Read the <a href="https://waypointproject.io/docs">documentation</a> for more about Waypoint.

## Next Steps

In this tutorial, you learned about Waypoint and the application workflow, set up a Waypoint server and client on Kubernetes, and built, deployed, updated, and redeployed an application.

Learn how to deploy applications to other platforms with Waypoint by checking out the [Docker](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-docker/get-started-docker) and [Nomad](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-nomad/get-started-nomad) tutorials.

Continue on to the next tutorial by clicking on the **Next** button below. You will learn how to interact with a running application container and browse the Waypoint web UI.

Be sure to follow the steps in the [Destroy the Deployment from Kubernetes](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-kubernetes/get-started-kubernetes-destroy) tutorial when you are ready to uninstall the Waypoint components and clean up your Kubernetes cluster. It comes after the next tutorial about using the Waypoint web UI.
