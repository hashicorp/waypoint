# Input Variables

Input variables make your Waypoint configuration more flexible by defining
values that your end users can assign to customize the configuration. They
provide a consistent interface to change how a given configuration behaves.

In this tutorial you will run an application and use custom input
variables to parameterize the configuration. You can use input variables to
serve as parameters for a Waypoint configuration, allowing aspects of the
application lifecycle to be customized without altering the waypoint.hcl file.
Waypoint input variables are also useful when you want to repeatedly reference
a certain value throughout your waypoint.hcl file.

## Prerequisites

You should be familiar with the basics of running a Waypoint application using
a Waypoint server. This tutorial shows an example using a server
installed on Docker. Follow the [Waypoint on Docker tutorials](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-docker) to get set up.

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have a running Waypoint server.

### Clone the examples repository

This tutorial shows how to add custom input variables to a Waypoint configuration
for any application.

Clone the Waypoint examples repository.

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git
```

Navigate to an application in the `docker` directory. This tutorial uses
`waypoint-examples/docker/go' in the following steps.

```shell-session
$ cd waypoint-examples/docker/go
```

Open the `go` directory in a text editor.

## Define custom input variables in your configuration

Now that you have an application, you will:

- Define variables within the waypoint.hcl
- Deploy the application
- Set new values for the variable
- Deploy the application again

### Examine the `waypoint.hcl` file

```shell-session
$ cat waypoint.hcl
```

The `waypoint.hcl` file contains a basic app configuration.

```hcl
project = "example-go"

app "example-go" {
  labels = {
    "service" = "example-go",
    "env"     = "dev"
  }

  build {
    use "pack" {}
  }

  deploy {
    use "docker" {}
  }
}
```

### Define variables

Add the following variable definition blocks to the bottom of your config.

```hcl
variable "image" {
	default     = "waypoint-test/example-go"
	type        = string
	description = "Image name for the built image in the Docker registry."
}

variable "tag" {
	default     = "latest"
	type        = string
	description = "The tab for the built image in the Docker registry."
}
```

Variable blocks have three optional arguments.

- Default: The default value.
- Type: The type of data contained in the variable.
- Description: A short description to document the purpose of the variable.

We recommend setting these for all variables, but they are all optional. To
leave the `default` value unset, you must specify its value as `null`.

You will see some of the ways to assign values to variables later in this
tutorial. You must assign a value to a variable before Waypoint can evaluate the
configuration. However, if a variable is used in a stage that your command
does not run (for example, you are running `waypoint build` and the variable is only
used in the `waypoint deploy` stage), you do not need to assign the value at
run time.

Variable values must be literal values and cannot use computed values like
functions or other variables.

To refer to a variable in your configuration, use `var.<variable_name>`. This step
uses the `image` and `tag` variables that you added earlier as attributes for the
`registry` block.

Add a `registry` block to your `build` stage and set the `local` property to
`true` to keep our image stored locally. Configure the `image` and `tag` properties to
reference the variables you just defined:

```diff hideClipboard
...
  build {
    use "pack" {}
+   registry {
+     use "docker" {
+       image = var.image
+       tag   = var.tag
+       local = true
+     }
+   }
  }
...
```

The complete waypoint.hcl file should like this:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext hideClipboard
project = "example-go"

app "example-go" {
  labels = {
    "service" = "example-go",
    "env"     = "dev"
  }

  build {
    use "pack" {}
    registry {
      use "docker" {
        image = var.image
        tag   = var.tag
        local = true
      }
    }
  }

  deploy {
    use "docker" {}
  }
}

variable "tag" {
  default     = "latest"
  type        = string
  description = "The tab for the built image in the Docker registry."
}

variable "image" {
  default     = "waypoint-test/example-go"
  type        = string
  description = "Image name for the built image in the Docker registry."
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Deploy the application

Run the `waypoint init` command to initialize the application.

```shell-session
$ waypoint init
```

Run `waypoint up` to deploy the application to your local Docker instance.

```shell-session
$ waypoint up
```

Visit the URL shown in the output.

```plaintext hideClipboard
           URL: https://previously-ruling-elephant.waypoint.run
Deployment URL: https://previously-ruling-elephant--v1.waypoint.run
```

### Verify variable values

You can see the name and tag of your final image by viewing the output from
the previous step. The end of the build stage output should read:

```plaintext
Generated new Docker image: example-go:latest
✓ Tagging Docker image: example-go:latest => waypoint-test/example-go:latest
✓ Docker image pushed: waypoint-test/example-go:latest
```

You can also view it by looking at your local Docker images:

```shell-session
$ docker image ls | grep waypoint-test/example-go
```

Now change the variable value. Set one value with a command line
flag and one value via the UI.

First, open the UI.

```shell-session
$ waypoint ui -authenticate
```

Select the `go-example` project and click on the `Manage Settings` button.
You will see the following screen:

![Waypoint UI Project List](/img/tutorials/input-variables/project_list.png)

Click on the `Input Variables` tab. You will see a page indicating that there
are currently no values assigned to defined variables:

![Waypoint UI Input Variables Empty](/img/tutorials/input-variables/input_vars_empty_settings.png)

Now add a value. Click on `+ Add variable`, and set the variable key to `image`
and the value to `waypoint-dev/example-go`.

![Waypoint UI Input Variables List](/img/tutorials/input-variables/input_vars_list.png)

The UI is one way to assign values to variables that have been defined
in the waypoint.hcl.

Another way is through CLI arguments. All Waypoint stage commands accept both
`var` and `var-file` flags to supply variable values. You will use
the `var` flag in this tutorial to assign a new value to the `tag` variable.

When you run `waypoint up`, both variables will receive new values -- `image`
from the UI, and `tag` from the CLI flag.

```shell-session
$ waypoint up -var tag="0.0.1"
```

You should observe both new variable values in the terminal output:

```plaintext
Generated new Docker image: example-go:latest
✓ Tagging Docker image: example-go:latest => waypoint-dev/example-go:0.0.1
✓ Docker image pushed: waypoint-dev/example-go:0.0.1
```

Verify the image is in your local Docker registry.

```shell-session
$ docker image ls | grep waypoint-dev/example-go
```

## Destroy the application

After you have completed this tutorial, destroy the deployment.

```shell-session
$ waypoint destroy -auto-approve
```

## Reference

In this tutorial you learned to define custom input variables in the
`waypoint.hcl` file, and supply values via different sources.

To see a completed example of the configuration we built in this guide, go

Refer to the [documentation][input-variables] for other details on Waypoint input
variables, including allowed variable types and other input value sources.
