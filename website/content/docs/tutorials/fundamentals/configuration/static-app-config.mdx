# Static Application Configuration

Modern cloud infrastructure is built of reusable components that can be modified
at build or deploy time for a specific purpose. Waypoint can build applications
with custom configuration and can even restart applications when configuration
values change.

## Challenge

Applications might read configuration values from a database, from a shared
key/value service, or from the immediate runtime environment. Waypoint can
provide values to applications via a configuration file or from the command
line.

## Solution

In this tutorial you will run a Go language application and configure it in two
ways.

- Write a configuration value in `waypoint.hcl`
- Set a value from the command line with `waypoint config set`

Both values will be displayed on a web page that is served by the Go application.

<Note>

 These techniques work for non-sensitive information. This tutorial
does not demonstrate Waypoint's ability to sync values from Vault or Kubernetes.

</Note>

## Prerequisites

You should be familiar with the basics of running a Waypoint application with
the `waypoint` binary. Follow the [Waypoint on Docker tutorials][/collections/waypoint/get-started-docker] to learn the basics.

You must also:

- Clone the code examples repository
- Install and run Docker or Docker Desktop

### Clone the examples repository

This tutorial uses a Go language application to display environment variables you
set with Waypoint. You do not need to know how to write Go applications. We
will show a few lines of code in multiple languages so you can become familiar
with working with environment variables using Waypoint.

Clone the Waypoint examples repository which contains the sample Go application.

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git
```

Navigate to the `waypoint-examples/learn/static-application-configuration` directory.

```shell-session
$ cd waypoint-examples/learn/static-application-configuration
```

Open the `static-application-configuration` directory in a text editor.

### Install and run Docker Desktop

Install the most recent stable version of Docker or [Docker
Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Linux">


Start the Docker daemon on Linux.

```shell-session
$ sudo service docker start
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="macOS">


Open Docker on macOS in order to run it.

```shell-session
$ open -a Docker
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


### Set up the Waypoint server

Waypoint runs as a server and a client, even if only run locally. For this tutorial, you'll run the server in Docker or Docker Desktop.

#### Install the Waypoint Server

Install the Waypoint server to Docker or Docker Desktop on your computer. This allows you
to view the user interface, collaborate on deployments, and more.

Run the following command to install the Waypoint server. The `-accept-tos` flag
confirms that you accept the terms of service for our [application URL
service](https://www.waypointproject.io/terms).

```shell-session
$ waypoint install -platform=docker -accept-tos
```

## Examine the Go code

The [main.go][] file defines a Go application that serves a minimal web page
which displays information about a sale. You can configure the discount (10%,
20%, 50%) and the day that the sale ends on (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).

This code will:

- Read one or more environment variables
- Use the value of the variables to modify the behavior of the application

In order to read environment variables, you must import the `os` module.

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
)
```

The `main` function defines a `saleViewHandler` which will render an HTML string
that displays the sale percentage and the day on which the sale ends.

```go
func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", saleViewHandler)

	fmt.Printf("Starting server at: http://localhost:3000\n")
	if err := http.ListenAndServe(":3000", nil); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

Go and other languages are built with support for reading environment variables.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Go">


```go
salePercent := os.Getenv("SALE_PERCENT")
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="JavaScript">


```javascript
salePercent = process.env.SALE_PERCENT
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Python">


```python
import os

salePercent = os.getenv('SALE_PERCENT')
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Java">


```java
String sale_percent = System.getenv("SALE_PERCENT");
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Ruby">


```ruby
sale_percent = ENV["SALE_PERCENT"]
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="C#">


```csharp
var salePercent = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SALE_PERCENT");
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


The `saleViewHandler` function uses `os.Getenv` to read the values of
`SALE_PERCENT` and `SALE_ENDS_ON` from the environment.

The `Fprintf` line builds an HTML string to display these values. In a
production scenario, you would use a templating language such as [Go
templates][] to define an HTML document with variables.

```go
func saleViewHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	salePercent := os.Getenv("SALE_PERCENT")
	saleEndsOn := os.Getenv("SALE_ENDS_ON")

	fmt.Fprintf(w, `
	<style>body { font-size: 3em; }</style>
	<h1>Today&#8217;s Sale</h1>
	<div>Save %s!</div>
	<div>Until %s</div>
	`,
		salePercent,
		saleEndsOn)
}
```

## Use a hard-coded static configuration value

Now that you have a Go application that can display values, you will:

- Write a `waypoint.hcl` to populate the `SALE_PERCENT` variable
- Deploy the application
- Set a value with `waypoint config set`
- View the updated application in your web browser

### Examine the `waypoint.hcl` file

We've provided a `waypoint.hcl` file that sets a hard coded value for `SALE_PERCENT`.

```shell-session
$ cat waypoint.hcl
```

Configuration can be set at the project level or at the application level. For
this project, define an application-level variable in the `config` section under
`env`. You will only set the `SALE_PERCENT` value in this way.

```hcl
project = "example-go"

app "example-go" {
  labels = {
    "service" = "example-go",
    "env"     = "dev"
  }

  config {
    env = {
       SALE_PERCENT = "50%"
    }
  }

  build {
    use "pack" {}
  }

  deploy {
    use "docker" {}
  }
}
```

### Deploy the application

You can debug or run the Go application locally with the `go run` command. For
this tutorial, we will continue on to deploying the application with Waypoint.

```shell-session
$ go run main.go
```

Run the `init` command to initialize the application.

```shell-session
$ waypoint init
```

Run `waypoint up` to deploy the application to your local Docker instance.
Waypoint will compile the Go application inside a container and then deploy it
to Docker.

```shell-session
$ waypoint up
```

Visit the URL shown in the output.

```plaintext hideClipboard
           URL: https://mostly-massive-alien.waypoint.run
Deployment URL: https://mostly-massive-alien--v1.waypoint.run
```

You will see an application that displays the `SALE_PERCENT`.

![Web Application with Sale Percent](/img/tutorials/static-application-configuration/static_config_percent.png)

## Set a configuration value on an existing application

The page looks incomplete since there is no value after "Until."

In the code for the Go application, we read a value for `SALE_ENDS_ON`, but that
value has not been set. Let's set it from the command line. The sale will end on
Monday.

```shell-session
$ waypoint config set SALE_ENDS_ON=Monday
```

Waypoint will instantly restart the container with the new value. You must
manually refresh the web page to view it.

![Web Application with Sale Ends On](/img/tutorials/static-application-configuration/static_config_ends_on.png)

You can also verify that the change occurred by opening the Waypoint admin
console and looking at the logs.

```shell-session
$ waypoint ui -authenticate
```

You will observe lines that indicate Waypoint noticed a change in an
environment variable.

```plaintext hideClipboard
[INFO] entrypoint.config.watcher: env vars changed, sending new child command
[INFO] entrypoint.child: terminating current child process for restart
[WARN] entrypoint.child: subprocess exited: args=[/cnb/lifecycle/launcher] cmd=/cnb/lifecycle/launcher err="signal: terminated"
[INFO] entrypoint.child: child process exited: pid=15 wait_err=<nil>
[INFO] entrypoint.child: starting child process: args=[/cnb/lifecycle/launcher] cmd=/cnb/lifecycle/launcher
Starting server at: http://localhost:3000
```

## Destroy the application

After you have completed this tutorial, destroy the deployment.

```shell-session
$ waypoint destroy -auto-approve
```

## Next steps

Hard-coded configuration values in `waypoint.hcl` are useful for values that do
not change often but that do change between scenarios. They can also be used if
you want to deploy a pre-built container with custom configuration.

For example, you could use Waypoint to deploy the generic [MySQL Docker][]
container with a random password and a database named "education."

```hcl hideClipboard
# Minimal MySQL configuration example
config {
	env = {
		MYSQL_DATABASE = "education"
		MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD = "1"
	}
}
```

When the container is deployed, the Waypoint logs will display the generated
password and the name of the database that was created on startup. This can be
achieved with an existing MySQL container and a few environment variables
specified with Waypoint.

```plaintext hideClipboard
[Note] [Entrypoint]: GENERATED ROOT PASSWORD: eesahph9chiesooth0theL7ooso4cen7
[Note] [Entrypoint]: Creating database education
```

## Reference

In this tutorial you learned to define Waypoint configuration values in the
`waypoint.hcl` file or on the command line with `waypoint config set`.
