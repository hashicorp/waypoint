<Warning>

This content is part of the legacy version of Waypoint that is no longer actively maintained. For additional information on the new vision of Waypoint, check out [this blog post](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/a-new-vision-for-hcp-waypoint) and the [HCP Waypoint documentation](/hcp/docs/waypoint).

</Warning>

# Using HCP Waypoint with Your Infrastructure

HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) is a fully managed platform for Terraform, Vault, Consul and now, Waypoint. HCP Waypoint improves your experience as a developer by making the workflow more easily consumable and enabling faster onboarding and deployments. It abstracts away the server components and reduces the overall operational effort of running Waypoint.

Until now, Waypoint promised easy application deployment with minimal devops, but required you to do quite a bit of devops in order to get there. HCP Waypoint eliminates most of that work so you can get straight to writing and deploying your applications.

HCP Waypoint allows you to create, connect, and use [runners](/waypoint/docs/runner) on your own infrastructure to execute operations. By managing these runners on your own, you have the flexibility to control dependency libraries and other configurations while still getting the benefits of HCP Waypoint.

## Runners

[Runners](/waypoint/docs/runner) are the Waypoint components that execute each operation defined in a `waypoint.hcl` file and come in one of three types: CLI runners, remote runners, and on-demand runners.

A [CLI runner](/waypoint/docs/runner#cli-runner) operates alongside the CLI and acts as the default runner to use.

A [remote runner](/waypoint/docs/runner#remote-runner) is a persistent runner installed on a platform with its associated plugin and can be targeted with a runner profile for task execution. [Officially supported platforms](/waypoint/docs/runner/run-manual#installing-a-runner) include Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS, and Nomad. It is also referred to as a static runner.

An [on-demand runner](/waypoint/docs/runner/on-demand-runner) is a single-use ephemeral runner that is created by a remote runner on the platform that the remote runner is installed on to perform one job.

In this tutorial, you will be using a CLI runner to execute the local Docker build and deployment, then install a remote runner on AWS ECS, and use it to create on-demand runners also on ECS.

### Runner labels

Runner labels are tags that can be assigned to a runner during the installation process. These tags can be identifiers for configurations like platform, environment, and other capabilities.

<CodeBlockConfig heading="Example runner installation with a label defined" hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ waypoint runner install -platform=ecs -id=ecs-runner -- -label=cluster=ecs
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Runner profiles

[Runner profiles](/waypoint/docs/runner/profiles) are used to target runners via labels, set environment configurations for them, and as a template for creating new on-demand runners.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ waypoint runner profile list
Runner profiles
       NAME      | PLUGIN TYPE |               OCI URL         |       TARGET RUNNER       | DEFAULT
-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------+---------------------------+---------
  ecs-ecs-runner | aws-ecs     | hashicorp/waypoint-odr:latest | labels: {"cluster":"ecs"} |    
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

A `waypoint.hcl` file can then be configured to use a runner profile for tasks defined at the project or app level.

<CodeBlockConfig heading="Targeting a runner with the ecs-ecs-runner profile" hideClipboard>

```hcl
project = "waypoint-runner-example"

app "ecs" {
  runner {
    profile = "ecs-ecs-runner"
  }

  build {
    # ...
  }

  deploy {
    # ...
  }
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, you will need:

- [Waypoint 0.10.0](/waypoint/downloads/) or later installed locally (follow along with the [Install Waypoint](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-docker/get-started-install) guide)
- An [HCP Account](/hcp/docs/hcp/create-account)
- A free [DockerHub personal account](https://docs.docker.com/docker-id/)
- An account on a hosted Git provider site (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed locally
- An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free) and the [AWS CLI tool](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed locally
- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [`terraform`](/terraform/downloads/) CLI tools installed locally

## Set up the environment

The Waypoint context is what your local Waypoint CLI uses to communicate with HCP Waypoint. DockerHub is the service you will be using in this tutorial to store the application images. You will set up both of these in the next section.

### Set up HCP Waypoint context

[Sign in to your account](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in) on HCP and click on the **Waypoint** option from the left navigation.

![Select the Waypoint option from the left navigation on HCP](/img/tutorials/hcp-runners/hcp-ui-waypoint-option.jpg)

Click the **Manage** button on the top right of the page, click on the clipboard icon to copy the `waypoint context create` command, and run it in your terminal. Your Waypoint CLI can now communicate with HCP Waypoint.

![Copy the command from HCP Waypoint to create a local context](/img/tutorials/hcp-runners/hcp-waypoint-context-dialog.jpg)

### Set up DockerHub configuration

To access DockerHub for pushing and pulling images, Waypoint requires authentication credentials. It supports credential definitions in the `waypoint.hcl` file and ["out of band" authentication](/waypoint/docs/lifecycle/build#out-of-band-authentication) by reading configurations set locally by a `docker login` either through the Docker CLI or Docker Desktop. In this tutorial, you will be providing DockerHub token credentials through environment variables.

Navigate to DockerHub, log in, and create an access token by visiting the [security settings page](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security) and clicking the **New Access Token** button. Give the token a description, select the **Read, Write, Delete** permission option from the dropdown, and click the **Generate** button.

![Create an access token on DockerHub](/img/tutorials/hcp-runners/dockerhub-token-creation.jpg)

Copy the token value and export it as an environment variable.

```shell-session
$ export REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<YOUR_TOKEN>
```

Then export your DockerHub username.

```shell-session
$ export REGISTRY_USERNAME=<YOUR_USERNAME>
```

Then the image name.

```shell-session
$ export REGISTRY_IMAGENAME=learn-hcp-waypoint-runners
```

Finally, export your preferred AWS region.

```shell-session
$ export TF_VAR_region=<YOUR_AWS_REGION_PREFERENCE>
```

### Fork the example repository

The [example repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-hcp-waypoint-runners.git) contains an example application and Dockerfile, a Terraform configuration to deploy an ECS cluster, and a `waypoint.hcl` file for building and deploying the application to each environment.

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the example repository and set your forked repository as an environment variable. Creating a fork allows you to connect a repository you have control over to your HCP Waypoint project and is required for making changes to the code.

<Note>

 Be sure to make your forked repository public or you will need to add authentication credentials to the project's settings in HCP Waypoint.

</Note>

```shell-session
$ export MY_REPO_URL="https://github.com/<YOUR_FORKED_REPOSITORY>.git"
```

Clone the repository to your local machine.

```shell-session
$ git clone $MY_REPO_URL hcp-runners-tutorial
```

Change into the `hcp-runners-tutorial` directory.

```shell-session
$ cd hcp-runners-tutorial
```

## Build and deploy dev

Open the example repository directory in your terminal and inspect the `app "dev"` block in the `waypoint.hcl` file. This is for building and deploying the application to your local Docker environment.

Notice that the two registry variables for accessing DockerHub get their values from the environment variables you just set. They are used for authentication in the `use` block when pushing the image to DockerHub.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/waypoint.hcl" highlight="4,11,27-28" hideClipboard>

```hcl
variable "registry_username" {
  type = string
  default = ""
  env = ["REGISTRY_USERNAME"]
}

variable "registry_password" {
  type = string
  sensitive = true
  default = ""
  env = ["REGISTRY_PASSWORD"]
}

# ...

project = "learn-hcp-runners"

app "dev" {
  build {
    use "docker" {}
    registry {
      use "docker" {
        image = "${var.registry_username}/${var.registry_imagename}"
        tag = "dev"
        local = false
        auth {
          username = var.registry_username
          password = var.registry_password
        }
      }
    }
  }
  # ...
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Initialize the project.

```shell-session
$ waypoint init
✓ Configuration file appears valid
✓ Connection to Waypoint server was successful
✓ Project "learn-hcp-runners" and all apps are registered with the server.
✓ Project "learn-hcp-runners" pipelines are registered with the server.

Project initialized!
```

Then build and deploy the image to your local Docker environment. The `-local=true` option instructs Waypoint to execute the tasks on a local runner instead of on a remote runner.

```shell-session
$ waypoint up -local=true

The deploy was successful!

The release did not provide a URL and the URL service is disabled on the
server, so no further URL information can be automatically provided. If
this is unexpected, please ensure the Waypoint server has both the URL service enabled and advertise addresses set.
```

List the running Docker containers on your system and filter for the one that is running the image that Waypoint just built.

```shell-session
$ docker container list \
    --format "{{ .ID }} {{ .Image }} {{ .Ports }}" \
    | grep -i ${REGISTRY_IMAGENAME}
```

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
f78af293007c arussohashi/learn-hcp-waypoint-runners:dev 0.0.0.0:65201->8080/tcp
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Visit the application in your browser on `localhost` using the mapped port in the Docker output. Waypoint randomizes this port so it will be different each time a deployment happens. In this case, the application is running on `localhost:65201`.

![The example application running locally on Docker](/img/tutorials/hcp-runners/example-docker-application.jpg)

## Update project for remote runners

Installing remote runners allows you to build and deploy your application on infrastructure separate and different from your local machine. Since the runners are external from your local machine, they require that the `waypoint.hcl` file and any associated code be accessible from a hosted Git repository.

Configure the Waypoint project to use your forked repository.

<Tip>

 You can provide repository information such as branch, path to the Waypoint configuration file, authentication, and more with the [`waypoint project apply` flags](/waypoint/commands/project-apply#command-options).

</Tip>

```shell-session
$ waypoint project apply -data-source=git -git-url=$MY_REPO_URL -git-ref=main learn-hcp-runners
✓ Project "learn-hcp-runners" updated
```

Verify that the project's settings contain the repository URL and that the `Remote Enabled` setting is `true`.

```shell-session
$ waypoint project inspect
» Project Info:
              Project Name: learn-hcp-runners
              Applications: dev, ecs
                Workspaces: default
            Remote Enabled: true
               Data Source: Git
                   Git URL: https://github.com/<YOUR_FORKED_REPOSITORY>.git
                   Git Ref: main
  Data Source Poll Enabled: false
   App Status Poll Enabled: false
        File Change Signal: SIGINT
```

Remote runners do not access environment variables in your local environment so the DockerHub variables defined earlier must be set for the runners in the project. 

Set the environment variables for the project runners by using the local variables you have already set.

```shell-session
$ waypoint config set -runner REGISTRY_USERNAME=${REGISTRY_USERNAME} && \
    waypoint config set -runner REGISTRY_PASSWORD=${REGISTRY_PASSWORD} && \
    waypoint config set -runner REGISTRY_IMAGENAME=${REGISTRY_IMAGENAME}
```

Then set the AWS region variable.

```shell-session
$ waypoint config set -runner TF_VAR_region=${TF_VAR_region}
```

Finally, verify that the project's runner settings contain the correct values.

```shell-session
$ waypoint config get -runner
   SCOPE  |        NAME        |                VALUE                 | WORKSPACE | LABELS  
----------+--------------------+--------------------------------------+-----------+---------
  project | REGISTRY_IMAGENAME | learn-hcp-waypoint-runners           |           |         
  project | REGISTRY_PASSWORD  | <YOUR_TOKEN>                         |           |         
  project | REGISTRY_USERNAME  | <YOUR_USERNAME>                      |           |         
  project | TF_VAR_region      | <YOUR_AWS_REGION_PREFERENCE>         |           |         
```

## Set up AWS ECS cluster setup

Waypoint requires an existing ECS cluster to install the runner into. Open the repository directory in your terminal and use Terraform to create a cluster. 

<Tip>

 Waypoint looks for a cluster named `waypoint-server` by default but you can choose a different name and provide it to the `waypoint runner install` command with the [`-ecs-cluster`](/waypoint/commands/runner-install#ecs-cluster) flag.

</Tip>

Initialize Terraform to download required plugins and set up the workspace.

```shell-session
$ terraform init
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v4.32.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v4.32.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

Then, create the cluster with Terraform. Remember to confirm the run by entering `yes`.

```shell-session
$ terraform apply

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_ecs_cluster.wp-ecs-cluster will be created
  + resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "wp-ecs-cluster" {
      + arn                = (known after apply)
      + capacity_providers = (known after apply)
      + id                 = (known after apply)
      + name               = "waypoint-server"
      + tags_all           = (known after apply)

      + default_capacity_provider_strategy {
          + base              = (known after apply)
          + capacity_provider = (known after apply)
          + weight            = (known after apply)
        }

      + setting {
          + name  = (known after apply)
          + value = (known after apply)
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

# ...

aws_ecs_cluster.wp-ecs-cluster: Creation complete after 10s [id=arn:aws:ecs:ca-central-1:561656980159:cluster/waypoint-server]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

## Install the ECS runner

Create and connect a new runner to HCP Waypoint. Waypoint will automatically register the runner with HCP Waypoint and create a runner profile for it as part of the installation process. This process will take a couple of minutes to complete.

```shell-session
$ waypoint runner install -platform=ecs -server-addr=api.hashicorp.cloud:443 \
    -id=ecs-runner -ecs-runner-image=hashicorp/waypoint \
    -ecs-region=${TF_VAR_region} -- -label=cluster=ecs
```

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
✓ Finished connecting to: api.hashicorp.cloud:443
✓ Runner "ecs-runner" installed successfully to ecs
✓ Runner profile "ecs-ecs-runner" created successfully.
✓ Networking setup
✓ EFS ready
✓ Found existing IAM role to use: waypoint-runner-execution-role
✓ Found existing IAM role to use: waypoint-runner
✓ Using existing log group
✓ Runner service created
✓ Runner "ecs-runner" adopted successfully.
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Verify that the list of runners contains the ECS runner.

<Tip>

 You may see additional runners in the list such as a local runner - this is okay and won't impact the deployment to ECS.

</Tip>

```shell-session
$ waypoint runner list
              ID             |   STATE    |  KIND  |    LABELS    | LAST REGISTERED  
-----------------------------+------------+--------+--------------+------------------
  ecs-runner                 | adopted    | remote | cluster:ecs  |                  
```

Check that the list of runner profiles contains a profile for the ECS runner. Notice that it has the label `cluster: ecs` from the `waypoint runner install` command you ran earlier.

```shell-session
$ waypoint runner profile list
Runner profiles
       NAME      | PLUGIN TYPE |               OCI URL         |       TARGET RUNNER       | DEFAULT
-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------+---------------------------+----------
  ecs-ecs-runner | aws-ecs     | hashicorp/waypoint-odr:latest | labels: {"cluster":"ecs"} |         
```

## Build and deploy to ECS

Remember that the project is configured with the Git repository that contains the application code and the `waypoint.hcl` file. Start the build and deploy process for ECS by targeting the `ecs` app defined in `waypoint.hcl`. The `-local=false` flag instructs Waypoint to run this process on the remote runner specified in the `waypoint.hcl` file.

<Tip>

 Even though you are running the command locally, the runner will not read the `waypoint.hcl` file present in the local directory but instead the one in the remote repository.

</Tip>

<Note>

 If you encounter an error where Waypoint can't get a runner (`! Failed to inspect the runner ... desc = failed to get runner`) and that the git clone has failed (`! Git clone failed: authentication required`), it is because your repository is private. You need to either make the repository public or add authentication to the project in HCP Waypoint by clicking on the project from the main page, **Settings** from the left navigation, the **Edit settings** button in the top right, selecting the **Username & password** radio button, typing in your credentials, and saving with the **Apply changes** button.

</Note>

```shell-session
$ waypoint up -app=ecs -local=false

The deploy was successful! This deploy was done in-place so the deployment
URL may match a previous deployment.

   Release URL: http://waypoint-ecs-ecs-2033600519.ca-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

A release URL is created as part of the ECS deployment and printed in the output. In this case, the application is running on `http://waypoint-ecs-ecs-2033600519.ca-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com`. Visit the application in your browser. Note that the application may take a minute to load.

<Tip>

 You can make changes, push them to the repository, and run the `waypoint up` command again to have Waypoint rebuild and redeploy to ECS.

</Tip>

![The example application running on AWS ECS](/img/tutorials/hcp-runners/example-ecs-application.jpg)

You can inspect the different builds, deployments, releases, and more in the HCP Waypoint UI after clicking on an application in the project. When you are ready, proceed to the cleanup section below.

![The deployments page of HCP Waypoint with the navigation highlighted](/img/tutorials/hcp-runners/hcp-waypoint-app-ui.jpg)

## Cleanup

Destroy the Waypoint deployments and releases. The [`waypoint project destroy` command](/waypoint/commands/project-destroy) deletes all resources of the applications in the project including deployments and releases. The `-auto-approve` flag tells Waypoint to destroy the project resources without prompting for approval.

Delete the ECS cluster with Terraform. Remember to confirm the run by entering `yes`.

```shell-session
$ terraform destroy
Terraform will perform the following actions:

aws_ecs_cluster.wp-ecs-cluster: Destruction complete after 0s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
```

<Note>

 In some rare cases, the cluster will still exist despite Terraform reporting that it has been destroyed. If this is the case, manually destroy the cluster with `aws ecs delete-cluster --cluster=waypoint`.

</Note>

Verify that the cluster has been destroyed.

```shell-session
$ aws ecs list-clusters
{
    "clusterArns": []
}
```
