# Deploy an Application to AWS Elastic Container Service

With Waypoint, it is quick and easy to deploy and release applications on [AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs).

In this tutorial, you will use Waypoint's [AWS ECS
plugin](/waypoint/plugins/aws-ecs) to build a container image containing a NodeJS application, push it to a [Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) repository, then deploy and update the application to ECS.

## Prerequisites

You will need to install [`waypoint` binary locally](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-docker/get-started-install), clone the examples repository (detailed in the next section), set up your AWS credentials, and create an Elastic Container Registry.

You will be most comfortable if you have already used Waypoint to do a local deployment with our [Get Started](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-docker) tutorials.

**Optional**: Provision a Kubernetes cluster and install the Waypoint server to Kubernetes in order to unlock all Waypoint functionality (including application `logs`, `exec`, and `ui` access).

### Clone the examples repository

The code for this tutorial is in the `hashicorp/waypoint-examples` repository. Clone the repository with git.

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git
```

Change into the subdirectory for the AWS ECS project. This project uses NodeJS but the following instructions will work with any language that can be built with a cloud native buildpack.

```shell-session
$ cd waypoint-examples/aws/aws-ecs/nodejs
```

## Install the Waypoint server

The Waypoint server must be installed. You may install it locally which requires fewer steps but limits the functionality of some Waypoint commands. Or, install to a remote Kubernetes cluster for full functionality (including the `logs`, `exec`, and `ui` commands).

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Local">


You can run the Waypoint server locally in Docker in order to achieve a minimal deployment of your applications on ECS.

<Note>

 A local server used with a remote deployment only supports limited functionality. The `logs`, `exec`, and other commands require a remote server with a remote deployment.

</Note>

Install the Waypoint server to your local Docker instance.

```shell-session
$ waypoint install --platform=docker -accept-tos
```

If you run into any errors, see the [troubleshooting](/waypoint/docs/troubleshooting#waypoint-server-in-docker) page which has instructions for resetting the Waypoint server in Docker.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Remote">


For full functionality, provision an [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) cluster and install the Waypoint server.

Follow the [EKS Terraform tutorial](/terraform/tutorials/kubernetes/eks) which includes a Terraform configuration for provisioning the cluster. You must also configure your local `kubectl` command to communicate to the remote cluster (instructions are included in the tutorial).

Then, run the [install command](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-kubernetes/get-started-kubernetes#install-the-waypoint-server) to deploy the Waypoint server to the cluster.

```shell-session
$ waypoint install --platform=kubernetes -accept-tos

service/waypoint created
statefulset.apps/waypoint-server created
```

Verify the installation by running `kubectl get all`. If the installation was successful you will observe that the single container in the `waypoint-server-0` pod is ready and the pod has a status of `Running`.

```shell-session
$ kubectl get all

NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

## Explore `waypoint.hcl`

Open the
[`waypoint.hcl`](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples/blob/main/aws/aws-ecs/nodejs/waypoint.hcl)
file. In this section, you will explore the `build` and `deploy` steps for this
project.

The `waypoint.hcl` file uses the `aws-ecr` registry plugin during the `build` stage. The `aws-ecr` plugin uses your AWS credentials and internally builds the correct URL to the AWS API.

It is also possible to configure this manually with the `docker` plugin. Other
configuration options are listed in the [plugin
documentation](/waypoint/plugins/aws-ecs#aws-ecr-registry).

```hcl
build {
  use "pack" {}
  registry {
    use "aws-ecr" {
      region     = "us-east-1"
      repository = "waypoint-example"
      tag        = "latest"
    }
  }
}
```

Use the `aws-ecs` plugin for the `deploy` stage. You can specify the `region`, `memory`, and `cpu` as well as a `count` of how many instances to launch or a `log_group` to store the logs in a CloudWatch log group.

See the [plugin documentation](/waypoint/plugins/aws-ecs#aws-ecs-platform) for other configuration options.

```hcl
deploy {
  use "aws-ecs" {
    region = "us-east-1"
    memory = "512"
  }
}
```

<Note>

 When using this configuration, Waypoint will automatically provision an ECS cluster that uses Fargate. Fargate instances are temporary and will only run while they are being actively used. Read the [plugin documentation](/waypoint/plugins/aws-ecs#aws-ecs-platform) if you prefer to use permanent EC2 instances in an existing ECS cluster instead.

</Note>

## Initialize Waypoint

Initialize the project with the `init` command.

```shell-session
$ waypoint init

✓ Configuration file appears valid
✓ Connection to Waypoint server was successful
✓ Project "example-nodejs" and all apps are registered with the server.
✓ Plugins loaded and configured successfully

Project initialized!

You may now call 'waypoint up' to deploy your project or
commands such as 'waypoint build' to perform steps individually.
```

Read the [troubleshooting](/waypoint/docs/troubleshooting#waypoint-server-in-docker) page if you run into any errors.

## Build, deploy, and release the application

Deploy the application with `up`.

<Note>

 This may take a few minutes to execute, especially if this is the first time that you push the image to the registry.

</Note>

```shell-session
$ waypoint up

» Releasing...

The deploy was successful! A Waypoint deployment URL is shown below. This
can be used internally to check your deployment and is not meant for external
traffic. You can manage this hostname using "waypoint hostname."

   Release URL: http://waypoint-ecs-example-nodejs-1065146915.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
Deployment URL: https://barely-big-hen--v1.waypoint.run
```

Visit the Release URL or the Deployment URL to view the application running on ECS.

![Web application](/img/tutorials/get-started/web-app.png)

You can visit the [ECS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-1#/clusters) to view the server side of the cluster.

![ECS cluster](/img/tutorials/aws/aws-ecs-cluster.png)

The cluster also lists individual tasks.

## Destroy the instance

To deprovision the container, run `destroy`.

```shell-session
$ waypoint destroy -auto-approve

» Destroying releases for application 'example-nodejs'...

» Destroying deployments for application 'example-nodejs'...
Destroy successful!
```

If there is an error, try again after a few seconds.

<Note>

 The `destroy` command will not delete container images in the registry or the ECS cluster itself. Visit the [ECR console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories?region=us-east-1) to manually delete the entire registry or individual container images.

</Note>
