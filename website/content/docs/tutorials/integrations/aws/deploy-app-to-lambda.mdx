# Deploy an Application onto AWS Lambda

With Waypoint, it is quick and easy to deploy and release applications on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda).

In this tutorial, you will use Waypoint's [AWS Lambda
plugin](/waypoint/plugins/aws-lambda) to build a Docker image containing a Ruby application, push it to a [Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) repository, then deploy the image to Lambda. Afterwards, you will update the application and deploy the updated application.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to install [`waypoint` 0.3.0 or greater locally](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-docker/get-started-install), clone the example repository (detailed in the next section), set up your AWS credentials, and create an Elastic Container Registry.

You'll be most comfortable if you have already used Waypoint to do a local deployment with our [Get Started](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-docker) collection.

**Optional**: Provision a Kubernetes cluster and install the Waypoint server to Kubernetes in order to unlock all Waypoint functionality (including application `logs`, `exec`, and `ui` access).

### Clone the examples repository

The code for this tutorial is in the `hashicorp/waypoint-examples` repository. Clone the repository with git.

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git
```

Change into the cloned repository. This project uses Ruby but the following instructions will work with any language that can be built with a cloud native buildpack.

```shell-session
$ cd aws/lambda/ruby
```

## Install the Waypoint server

The Waypoint server must be installed. You may install it locally which requires fewer steps but limits the functionality of some Waypoint commands. Or, install to a Kubernetes or Nomad cluster for full functionality (including the `logs`, `exec`, and `ui` commands).

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Local">


You can run the Waypoint server locally in Docker in order to achieve a minimal deployment of your applications on ECS.

<Note>

 A local server used with a remote deployment only supports limited functionality. The `logs`, `exec`, and other commands require a remote server with a remote deployment.

</Note>

Install the Waypoint server to your local Docker instance.

```shell-session
$ waypoint install --platform=docker -accept-tos
```

If you run into any errors, see the [troubleshooting](/waypoint/docs/troubleshooting#waypoint-server-in-docker) page which has instructions for resetting the Waypoint server in Docker.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Remote">


For full functionality, provision an [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) cluster and install the Waypoint server.

Follow the [EKS Terraform tutorial](/terraform/tutorials/kubernetes/eks) which includes a Terraform configuration for provisioning the cluster. You must also configure your local `kubectl` command to communicate to the remote cluster (instructions are included in the tutorial).

Then, run the [install command](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-kubernetes/get-started-kubernetes#install-the-waypoint-server) to deploy the Waypoint server to the cluster.

```shell-session
$ waypoint install --platform=kubernetes -accept-tos

service/waypoint created
statefulset.apps/waypoint-server created
```

Verify the installation by running `kubectl get all`. If the installation was successful you will observe that the single container in the `waypoint-server-0` pod is ready and the pod has a status of `Running`.

```shell-session
$ kubectl get all

NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/waypoint-server-0   1/1     Running   0          2m34s

```

## Explore `waypoint.hcl`

Open the
[`waypoint.hcl`](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples/tree/main/aws/lambda/ruby/waypoint.hcl)
file. In this section, you will explore the `build`, `deploy`, and `release` steps for this
project.

- The `waypoint.hcl` file uses the `aws-ecr` registry plugin during the `build` stage. The `aws-ecr` plugin uses your AWS credentials and internally builds the correct URL to the AWS API.

  It is also possible to configure this manually with the `docker` plugin. Other configuration options are listed in the [plugin documentation](/waypoint/plugins/aws-ecs#aws-ecr-registry).

  ```hcl
  build {
    use "pack" {}
    registry {
      use "aws-ecr" {
        region     = "us-west-2"
        repository = "learn-waypoint-lambda"
        tag = "howdy-waypoint-lambda"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- Use the `aws-lambda` plugin for the `deploy` stage. The `region` parameter is required, but you can specify the `iam_role`, `memory` and `timeout` for your Lambda function. See the [plugin documentation](/waypoint/plugins/aws-lambda#aws-lambda-platform) for other configuration options.

  ```hcl
  deploy {
    use "aws-lambda" {
      region = "us-west-2"
    }
  }
  ```

- Finally, Waypoint will release your application using the `aws-alb` plugin, which will provision an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to serve traffic to your Lambda endpoint.

  ```hcl
  release {
    use "aws-alb" {
    }
  }
  ```

## Initialize Waypoint

Initialize the project with the `init` command.

```shell-session
$ waypoint init

✓ Configuration file appears valid
✓ Connection to Waypoint server was successful
✓ Project "learn-waypoint-lambda" and all apps are registered with the server.
✓ Plugins loaded and configured successfully

Project initialized!

You may now call 'waypoint up' to deploy your project or
commands such as 'waypoint build' to perform steps individually.
```

Read the [troubleshooting](/waypoint/docs/troubleshooting#waypoint-server-in-docker) page if you run into any errors.

## Build, deploy, and release the application

Deploy the application with `up`. Waypoint will error the first time when attempting to provision Lambda. This is expected behavior and will be resolved in a future release.

<Tip>

 This may take a few minutes to execute, especially if this is the first time that you push the image to the registry.

The deploy was successful! A Waypoint deployment URL is shown below. This
can be used internally to check your deployment and is not meant for external
traffic. You can manage this hostname using "waypoint hostname."

   Release URL: http://waypoint-learn-waypoint-lambda-380235335.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
Deployment URL: https://evenly-ethical-kid--v2.waypoint.run
```

Visit the Release URL or the Deployment URL to view the application running on Lambda.

![Web application](/img/tutorials/aws/lambda-web-app.png)

Try appending `?name=Turing` to the Release or Deployment URL (for example: `http://waypoint-learn-waypoint-lambda-1827600373.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/?name=Turing`). The service will return a welcome message with the name you inserted.

![Web application](/img/tutorials/aws/lambda-web-app-turing.png)

You can visit the [Lambda console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-west-2#/functions?f0=true&n0=false&op=and&v0=learn-waypoint-lambda) to verify the deployed Lambda function.

![Lambda Console showing deployed Lambda function](/img/tutorials/aws/lambda-console.png)

## Update Lambda function

You can schedule a new application deployment through Waypoint.

First, update the welcome message in `handler.rb`.

```diff hideClipboard
require 'json'

def handler(event:, context:)
    # ..
    {
         # ..
-        "body": "<html><body><h1>Howdy #{name} from Lambda!</h1></html></body>"
+        "body": "<html><body><h1>Hello #{name} from Lambda!</h1></html></body>"
    }
end
```

Then, redeploy your application with the `up` command.

The deploy was successful! A Waypoint deployment URL is shown below. This
can be used internally to check your deployment and is not meant for external
traffic. You can manage this hostname using "waypoint hostname."

   Release URL: http://waypoint-learn-waypoint-lambda-380235335.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
Deployment URL: https://evenly-ethical-kid--v3.waypoint.run
```

Visit the Release URL or the Deployment URL to view the application running on Lambda.

<Tip>

 It might take a couple of minutes for the Lambda function to warm up.

</Tip>

![Web application](/img/tutorials/aws/updated-lambda-web-app.png)

Notice that Lambda is returning the updated welcome message.

## Destroy the instance

To deprovision the container, run `destroy`.

```shell-session
$ waypoint destroy

» Destroying shared deploy resources for application 'learn-waypoint-lambda'...
✓ Connecting to AWS
✓ Deleting Lambda function
✓ IAM role deleted
Destroy successful!
```

If there is an error, try again after a few seconds.

<Note>

 The `destroy` command will not delete container images in the registry or the ECS cluster itself. Visit the [ECR console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories?region=us-west-2) to manually delete the entire registry or individual container images.

</Note>

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you deployed a web application with Waypoint.

AWS Lambda can also be used to deploy an API Gateway or schedule periodic tasks as with `cron`.

Experiment with omitting the `aws-alb` releaser if you want to use Waypoint to build and deploy a container but use other AWS features with your deployed container.

Learn more about Waypoint by following along with the other [tutorials](/waypoint/tutorials/) for Azure, Google Cloud, and others, or read the documentation for other Waypoint [plugins](/waypoint/plugins/).
