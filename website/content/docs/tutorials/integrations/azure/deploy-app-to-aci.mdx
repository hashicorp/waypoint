# Deploy an application onto an Azure Container Instance

Waypoint's [Azure Container Instances (ACI)
plugin](/waypoint/plugins/azure-container-instance) works
with [Azure Container
Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/) to
run containers on Azure's cloud infrastructure. In this tutorial, you will
deploy build, deploy and release a sample project to ACI.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to install the [`waypoint` binary locally](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-docker/get-started-install),
clone the examples repository (detailed in the next section), login to Azure, create a container registry,
and set a few environment variables.

### Clone the examples repository

The code for this tutorial is in the `hashicorp/waypoint-examples` repository. Clone the repository with git.

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git
```

Navigate to the subdirectory for the Azure Container Instance project. This
project uses NodeJS but the following instructions will work with any language
that can be built with a cloud native buildpack.

```shell-session
$ cd waypoint-examples/azure/azure-container-instance/nodejs
```

### Login to Azure locally

Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) and login. Your web browser will open to the Azure website.

```shell-session
$ az login
```

### Create an Azure Container Registry

You'll need to create an Azure Container Registry to store your Docker images.

Visit the [Azure Container Registry
page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry%2Fregistries).
Click the "Add" button and fill out the form to create a new registry. You can
use the default resource group or any that is available to you. Use the name
`waypointregistry` or any alphanumeric name that has not been taken.

Leave this window open so you can reference it later.

![Azure Container Registry](/img/tutorials/azure/container-registry-created.png)

Two more steps are needed. Run the `acr update` command to update the permissions on the registry.

```shell-session
$ az acr update -n waypointregistry --admin-enabled true
```

Now, login to the Azure Container Registry.

```shell-session
$ az acr login --name waypointregistry
```

### Set environment variables

You must set three environment variables to successfully push a Docker image to the registry and deploy an application that uses it.

The first is your `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.

```shell-session
$ export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa"
```

The next two are a name and password for the Container Registry. Return to the container registry screen from the previous section. Find the "Access Keys" menu item. On the configuration screen is a username and two passwords.

![Registry access keys](/img/tutorials/azure/registry-keys.png)

Copy the username to your clipboard. Set a local environment variable named `REGISTRY_USERNAME`. This is an environment variable defined by the Waypoint ACI plugin.

```shell-session
$ export REGISTRY_USERNAME="waypointuser"
```

Then, copy either password (there are two). Set a local environment variable named `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`.

```shell-session
$ export REGISTRY_PASSWORD="aaaaaa"
```

You have now completed the configuration needed to continue to the other steps in this tutorial.

## Install the local Waypoint server

Install the Waypoint server to your local Docker instance. It will not run on ACI so you can run it locally on Docker.

```shell-session
$ waypoint install --platform=docker -accept-tos
```

If you run into any errors, refer to the
[troubleshooting](/waypoint/docs/troubleshooting#waypoint-server-in-docker)
page which has instructions for resetting the Waypoint server in Docker.

## Configure waypoint

The `waypoint-examples` git repository you cloned earlier contains a
`waypoint.hcl` file with configuration details for ACI.

Here are a few snippets that relate to Azure. The full configuration is
displayed further down.

In the `build` section, use the standard `docker` plugin but specify the URL to
your Azure registry and the `example-nodejs` Docker image. Edit this to match
the name of the Azure Container Registry you created earlier.

```hcl
use "docker" {
  image = "waypointregistry.azurecr.io/example-nodejs"
  tag   = "latest"
}
```

The second relevant section is the `deploy` stanza. In addition to defining the
`resource_group` and `location`, there is a section for the `capacity` of the
compute instance.

Other arguments are possible, including those for mounting a disk `volume` or
passing `static_environment` variables to the application. Refer to the [ACI
plugin
documentation](/waypoint/plugins/azure-container-instance)
for a list of other arguments.

```hcl
deploy {
  use "azure-container-instance" {
    resource_group = "DefaultResourceGroup-EUS"
    location       = "eastus"
    ports          = [8080]

    capacity {
      memory    = "512"
      cpu_count = 1
    }

  }
}
```

The entire `waypoint.hcl` looks like this.

```hcl
project = "example-nodejs"

app "example-nodejs" {
  labels = {
    "service" = "example-nodejs",
    "env"     = "dev"
  }

  build {
    use "pack" {}
    registry {
      use "docker" {
        image = "waypointregistry.azurecr.io/example-nodejs"
        tag   = "latest"
      }
    }
  }

  deploy {
    use "azure-container-instance" {
      resource_group = "DefaultResourceGroup-EUS"
      location       = "eastus"
      ports          = [8080]

      capacity {
        memory    = "512"
        cpu_count = 1
      }

    }
  }

}
```

## Initialize Waypoint

Once you have written the `waypoint.hcl` configuration file, initialize the Waypoint context.

```shell-session
$ waypoint init
```

## Run waypoint up

Now, build, deploy, and release the application with `up`.

```shell-session
$ waypoint up
```

It make take a few minutes to copy the Docker images to the server. When it
completes, the output will display a URL to your web application.

![Web application](/img/tutorials/get-started/web-app.png)

You can also verify the server side by visiting the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Search for "Azure Container Instance." You will see the `example-nodejs` instance with a CPU usage chart and other details.

## Destroy the deployment

After you have completed this tutorial, you can `destroy` the container instance.

```shell-session
$ waypoint destroy -auto-approve
```

<Note>

 This will not destroy the container registry or the disk images that were published to it.

</Note>
