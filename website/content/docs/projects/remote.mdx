# Remote Operations

Waypoint operations such as `waypoint up`, `build`, `deploy`, etc. can
be executed _remotely_ using [runners](/docs/runner). This enables
a variety of useful functionality and patterns:

- GitOps where builds, deploys, etc. are triggered by Git.
- Users don't need to have credentials for build or deployment targets,
  only the runners do. For example, if you're deploying an application
  AWS, only the runners need AWS credentials. Users only need a token
  for the Waypoint server to queue the deployment job.
- Private resource access. Every client only needs access to the
  Waypoint server. The runners can run on a private network to access
  internal resources.

## Requirements

Remote operations require:

- At least one [runner is installed and running](/docs/runner). Waypoint
  automatically installs a runner with `waypoint install`.

- Your project is configured with a [data source](/docs/waypoint-hcl/runner)
  so that the runners can clone the project source code.

- Your project has [remote operations enabled](/docs/waypoint-hcl/runner)

## Usage

### CLI

To execute a remote operation via the CLI, specify the project and application:

```shell-session
$ waypoint up my-project/web
```

If you have the local source checked out and your terminal working directory
is in your project source code, you can omit the project name and use the
`-remote` flag:

```shell-session
$ waypoint up -remote
```

You can substitute any operation for `up` such as `build`, `deploy`, `release`, etc.

Both of these approaches will queue a job with the server and remotely execute
that job on the runner. Execution output will stream to the client, but all
logic is executing remotely.

## Concurrency

Waypoint only allows a single operation per distinct `(workspace, project, app)`
combination. This applies to both local and remote operations. Therefore,
if one user runs `waypoint up` locally and another runs `waypoint up -remote`,
one of the operations will wait for the other to complete before continuing.

However, if a second user runs `waypoint up` in a _different project_ or
_different application in the same project_ or _different workspace_, that
operation will run concurrently so long as there is available runner capacity.
