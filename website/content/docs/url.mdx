# Waypoint URL Service

Applications deployed with Waypoint will receive a public `waypoint.run` URL
with a valid TLS certificate automatically generated via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
This URL can be used to quickly view your deployed applications and share your
applications with others. A Waypoint URL looks like:
`outspoken-laughing-duck.waypoint.run`.

The URL service is a free, public service hosted by HashiCorp. We have open
sourced the URL service so you can also self-host it if you choose. We apply
some limits to the public service to prevent abuse.

The URL service must be enabled on the Waypoint server and your applications
must use the [Waypoint entrypoint](/docs/entrypoint) for this functionality
to work.

~> **Warning:** The URLs generated by Waypoint are publicly routable. If you
do not want the public to view your application, disable the URL for your
app or keep the URL secret.

-> **Development Only!** Waypoint URLs are only meant for development usage
only. In the future we plan on supporting production-level traffic
but this is not a supported use case today and any production traffic will
likely hit usage limits.

## App URLs

Waypoint will register a unique URL per application per workspace.

The app URL will route to the released deployments only.

~> Internal beta: A bug currently routes the app URL to all deployments.

### Deployment URLs

A special syntax can be used to route to a specific deployment (even if
that deployment is not released). You can append `--<deployment id>` to your
generated hostname to route only to that deployment.

For example, if your app URL is `outspoken-laughing-duck.waypoint.run`,
and you have a deployment with an ID of `ABCD1234`, you can route directly to
that deployment via `outspoken-laughing-duck--ABCD1234.waypoint.run`
(note the **double hyphen**).

## Configuration

The URL service is configured in two places: the server and by project.

The server configuration is set directly via `waypoint server` command-line
flags. This determines whether the URL service is enabled at all and what
address to use for the service. The service is **enabled by default** and
points to the public Waypoint URL service.

Within each project and application, the URL service can further be configured.
A project or app can opt-out of a generated URL. This has no effect if the
URL service is disabled at the server level.

~> Internal beta: we need to document the waypoint.hcl fields better here.

## Protocols

The URL service today only supports HTTP services. We automatically provision
and serve a valid TLS certificate and will reject any insecure connections.
In the future we will support other protocols such as general TCP.

## Limits

We apply the following limits to the URL service to prevent abuse:

- **Requests per second.** There is a req/s limitation applied
  per URL to prevent excessive traffic. When this limit is reached
  connections will be rejected.

- **Bandwidth.** There is a bandwidth limitation applied to all URLs
  to prevent using the URL service for large file transfers. When this
  limit is reached, bandwidth will be throttled.

These limits cannot be raised today. In the future, we plan on providing
account registration to raise limits. HashiCorp has no intention of profiting from
this service, but we may charge for increased limits in the future to offset
costs. A free tier will always remain.

## Self-Hosting

You may choose to self-host the Waypoint URL service if you'd like. Doing this
will allow you to use a custom domain and may increase security for you. As a
warning, note that the Waypoint URL service wasn't built with ease of deployment
in mind and also requires additional infrastructure resources such as databases.
Self-hosting is advanced and is not generally recommended.

The Waypoint URL service is open source and requires two separate components
along with their supporting infrastructure. You may find installation instructions
in the README files of the services.

~> Internal beta: TODO. We need to open source these and link here.
