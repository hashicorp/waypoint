# Waypoint Documentation

Learn and develop your knowledge of Waypoint with these tutorials and code resources.

## Getting Started

- Begin with this brief [quick start tutorial](/docs/getting-started).
- Continue with an introductory tutorial on [Docker](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/waypoint/get-started-docker), [Kubernetes](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/waypoint/get-started-kubernetes), or [Nomad](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/waypoint/get-started-nomad).

## Deploying to the Cloud

Take Waypoint to the cloud with tutorials that deploy to public cloud infrastructure.

- AWS - Visit the [Elastic Container Service tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/waypoint/aws-ecs?in=waypoint/deploy-aws) or the Elastic Kubernetes Service tabs in the [Kubernetes tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/waypoint/get-started-kubernetes).
- Azure - Deploy to [Azure Container Instances](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/waypoint/azure-container-instance?in=waypoint/deploy-azure).
- Google Cloud - Learn from the [Google Cloud Run tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/waypoint/google-cloud-run?in=waypoint/deploy-google-cloud) or the Google Kubernetes Engine tabs in the [Kubernetes tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/waypoint/get-started-kubernetes).

## Running Code Samples

A growing number of code samples is available in the [hashicorp/waypoint-examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples) repository at GitHub. Use these examples or contribute your own.

```shell-session
git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git
```

## contrib Tools and Helpers

Some services and tools that Waypoint use involve some additional setup to run
and manage locally.

The `contrib` folder aims to help users reduce friction around getting started
using these tools locally to explore Waypoint. You can find these optional tools
and content on the [Waypoint GitHub repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/tree/main/contrib).

An example of this is leveraging [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to setup a
local kubernetnes cluster to install Waypoint server: [kind+k8s](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/tree/main/contrib/serverinstall/kind-k8s).

Don't see a tool here that you need to get started? Feel free to open a new
enhancement request issue on GitHub, or contribute your own!

## Extending

The [plugin documentation](/plugins) describes more resources available to use
in your Waypoint configuration. Contribute by writing your own plugin with this
[plugin tutorial](/docs/extending-waypoint/creating-plugins).

Integrate Waypoint into your continuous delivery workflow with examples for
[GitHub Actions](/docs/automating-execution/github-actions),
[GitLab CI/CD](/docs/automating-execution/gitlab-cicd),
[CircleCI](/docs/automating-execution/circle-ci), or
[Jenkins](/docs/automating-execution/jenkins).
