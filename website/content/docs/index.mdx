## Get Started with Waypoint

All of these walkthroughs use example applications and are designed to help you quickly try out the Waypoint deployment workflow.

If you're new to Waypoint, we recommend you start with the Docker walkthrough. This walkthrough will take about 10 minutes and uses an example app and Docker Desktop to illustrate the Waypoint workflow.

Once you have mastered the basics of Waypoint, try deploying an example app to Kubernetes or Nomad.
