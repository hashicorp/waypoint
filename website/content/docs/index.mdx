# Waypoint Documentation

Learn and develop your knowledge of Waypoint with these tutorials and code resources.

## Running Code Samples

A growing number of code samples is available in the [hashicorp/waypoint-examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples) repository at GitHub. Use these examples or contribute your own.

<CodeTabs tabs={[ "HTTPS", "SSH" ]}>

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git
```

```shell-session
$ git clone git@github.com:hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git
```

</CodeTabs>

## contrib Tools and Helpers

Some services and tools that Waypoint use involve some additional setup to run
and manage locally.

The `contrib` folder aims to help users reduce friction around getting started
using these tools locally to explore Waypoint. You can find these optional tools
and content on the [Waypoint GitHub repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/tree/main/contrib).

An example of this is leveraging [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to setup a
local kubernetnes cluster to install Waypoint server: [kind+k8s](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/tree/main/contrib/serverinstall/kind-k8s).

Don't see a tool here that you need to get started? Feel free to open a new
enhancement request issue on GitHub, or contribute your own!

## Extending

The [plugin documentation](/waypoint/plugins) describes more resources available to use
in your Waypoint configuration. Contribute by writing your own plugin with this
[plugin tutorial](/waypoint/docs/extending-waypoint/creating-plugins).

Integrate Waypoint into your continuous delivery workflow with examples for
[GitHub Actions](/waypoint/docs/automating-execution/github-actions),
[GitLab CI/CD](/waypoint/docs/automating-execution/gitlab-cicd),
[CircleCI](/waypoint/docs/automating-execution/circle-ci), or
[Jenkins](/waypoint/docs/automating-execution/jenkins).
