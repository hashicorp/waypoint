# Install Waypoint

-> Review this walkthrough's [prerequisites](docs/getting-started/nomad-example-app/install-prereqs) before installing Waypoint.

Waypoint uses both a client and a server to build, deploy, and release applications. This functionality is all available from a single binary.

## Download the Binary

To install Waypoint, find the appropriate package on [the releases site](https://go.hashi.co/waypoint-beta-binaries)
for your system and download it as a zip archive.

After downloading Waypoint, unzip the package. Waypoint runs as a single binary named `waypoint`. Any other files in the package can be safely removed and Waypoint will still function.

To make the binary available from anywhere on your system, you can either copy it into `/usr/local/bin` or add it to a different directory in your `PATH`. For instructions on how to do that, see [Editing your Path](#path).

```shell
$ cp ~/Downloads/waypoint /usr/local/bin
```

Validate the installation by running the `waypoint` command.

```
$ waypoint
Usage: waypoint [-version] [-help] [-autocomplete-(un)install] <command> [args]

Common commands:
    release      Release a deployment.
    up           Perform the build, deploy, and release steps for the app.
    build        Build a new versioned artifact from source.
...
```

## Install the Waypoint Server

Once the Waypoint binary location has been added to your path, execute the following command to install the Waypoint server on Nomad.

-> Note: Waypoint automatically creates the Nomad job for the Waypoint server. As this is behind an authenticated image repository
currently you may experience challenges with this if you are not using Nomad on your local machine. You may need to issue a `docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/alpha:latest`
from your Nomad clients in order to locally cache the image, and update the command below to use the `-server-image=` flag to reference this pull

```shell
 $ waypoint install --platform="nomad" --nomad-dc="dc1"
```
