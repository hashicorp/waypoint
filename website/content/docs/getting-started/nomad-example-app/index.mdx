# Deploy an Example Application to Nomad

This walkthrough takes you through using Waypoint to deploy applications onto an existing Nomad cluster and will give you a very quick overview of how Waypoint works.

- **Time required:** About 30 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Access to a running Nomad environment. You will also need a local copy of the [Waypoint Examples applications](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples).
