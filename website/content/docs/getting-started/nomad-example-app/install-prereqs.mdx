# Prerequisites

## Examples Repository

This walkthrough uses an example Nodejs application to show you how to build, deploy and release using Waypoint.

This example application is part of the [Waypoint Examples applications](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples). You will need a local clone of this repository on your computer to complete this walkthrough.

Clone the Waypoint Examples repository and navigate to the Nodejs example directory.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git

$ cd waypoint-examples/nodejs
```

## A Nomad Requirements

To get started with Nomad, review the [HashiCorp Learn tutorials for Nomad](https://learn.hashicorp.com/nomad).

### Nomad Environment

Waypoint supports Nomad both as a location for running the Waypoint server and as a runtime platform for application workloads.

### Nomad Environment Variable

Waypoint calls the 'NOMAD_ADDR' variable to interact with the Nomad environment. You will need to export this variable to use it in the Waypoint configuration file.

### Next Step
