# Waypoint Logs

When you include the Waypoint Entrypoint in your application, Waypoint gathers realtime logs for standard output (stdout) and standard error (sterr) for deployed applications.

Waypoint includes the Entrypoint within applications packaged as Docker containers by default.

## Example Log

To see the logs for a running appication, run the following command in the application's directory.

```bash
waypoint logs
```

You will see an output similar to the below in your Terminal window.

~>In this output, you will see that Waypoint is showing continuous probe checks for the root location. These probe checks are enabled by the `probe_path` value in the original `waypoint.hcl` file.
