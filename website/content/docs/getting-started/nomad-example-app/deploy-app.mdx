# Deploy Your App

### Deploying the Example Application

This application is configured to use Cloud Native Buildpacks to detect the language type of the application running and to build
the container for running in a container based environment. As a result, you do not need to build the Dockerfile manually as Waypoint will use the
default configurations of the relevant Cloud Native Buildpack. In our previous section, you also may have updated Waypoint to push the application
to a remote registry (assuming you are using an external Nomad cluster).

With this configuration in place and our application initialized we can issue the following command to build, deploy, and release
our application:

```shell-session
waypoint up
```

Waypoint will show the progressive status of the build, deploy, and release steps in the terminal output. As part of the deployment
workflow, Waypoint creates a preview URL for your application.

-> The preview URL is optional and can be disabled in the Waypoint server configuration.

Waypoint will show the result of your deployment in the Terminal, along with your specific preview URL.

```shell
The deploy was successful! A Waypoint deployment URL is shown below. This
can be used internally to check your deployment and is not meant for external
traffic. You can manage this hostname using "waypoint hostname."

           URL: https://instantly-worthy-shrew.alpha.waypoint.run
Deployment URL: https://instantly-worthy-shrew--v1.alpha.waypoint.run
```

~> For the initial release, Waypoint creates the preview URL on a HashiCorp service. Because this preview URL is connected to your
application and where it has been deployed, the URL will only show your application when it is running. In this walkthrough, this
means that your Nomad environment and the container for the deployed example NodeHJS application must both be running for the URL
to render your application.
