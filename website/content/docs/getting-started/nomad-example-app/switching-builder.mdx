In Waypoint we have 2 builder types, the `pack` builder and the `docker` builder. For users who already have a Dockerfile configured
to run their application, the Docker builder provides some great flexibility.

In this sample directory we've included 2 files, a default `Dockerfile` and an `nginx/default.conf` that contains the necessary
information for NGINX hosting our application. If you inspect these files, you'll note that they are both set to run our application
on port 80, which is different than the default of port that the pack builder uses. As part of updating our `build` process, we also
need to set the necessary changes to the rest of the `waypoint.hcl` file to support the new build.

Access the `waypoint.hcl` file and update it with the following `build` and `deploy` configuration to switch the builder to docker,
and update the containers service port to port 80.

```shell
...
build {
      use "docker" {}
      registry {
        use "docker" {
          image = "nodejs-example"
          tag = "latest"
        }
       }
    }

deploy {
  use "nomad" {
    datacenter="dc1"
    service_port = 80
  }
}
...
```

You'll note that we changed the `use "pack"` to now be `use "docker"` to the `build` configuration, as well as updated the `deploy`
configuration with a `service_port` configuration. This configuration allows us to set the listening port of the deployed resource.

Execute a `waypoint up` and observe the build process:

```bash
waypoint up
```

You'll note the build process looks a bit different this time as it's building your docker image using the dockerfile. Upon completion you'll once again receive the same Horizon URL,
which will now direct you to your application hosted within NGINX instead.
