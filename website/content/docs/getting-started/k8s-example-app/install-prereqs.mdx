# Prerequisites

## Examples Repository

This walkthrough uses an example NodeJS application to show you how to build, deploy and release using Waypoint.

This walkthrough will use an [example NodeJS application](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples/tree/master/kubernetes/nodejs) to show how to build, deploy, and release using Waypoint. This example is part
of the [waypoint-examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples) repository. You will need a local clone of this repository in order to leverage this guide.

Clone the Waypoint Examples repository and navigate to the NodeJS example directory.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git

$ cd waypoint-examples/kubernetes/nodejs
```

## A Kubernetes Environment

You can use any current Kubernetes distribution with Waypoint. Set your KubeConfig set with the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to allow access to the cluster.

<!-- Need to add details about how to set kubeconfig and example -->
