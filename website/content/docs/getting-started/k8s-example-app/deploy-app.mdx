# Deploy Your App

### Deploying the Example Application

This application is configured to use Cloud Native Buildpacks to detect the language type of the application running and to
build the container for running in Kubernetes. As a result, you do not need to build the Dockerfile manually as Waypoint will use
the default configurations of the relevant Cloud Native Buildpack.

In our previous step, we configured a remote Docker repository to store our build artifacts in.

With this configuration in place and our application initialized we can issue the following command to build, deploy, and release our application:

```bash
waypoint up
```

Waypoint will show the progressive status of the build, deploy, and release steps in the Terminal output. As part of the deployment workflow, Waypoint creates a preview URL for your application.

-> The preview URL is optional and can be disabled in the Waypoint server configuration.

Waypoint will show the result of your deployment in the Terminal, along with your specific preview URL.

```
The deploy was successful! A Waypoint deployment URL is shown below. This
can be used internally to check your deployment and is not meant for external
traffic. You can manage this hostname using "waypoint hostname."

           URL: https://instantly-worthy-shrew.alpha.waypoint.run
Deployment URL: https://instantly-worthy-shrew--01EJ0F2VYWTNTYJ6FNFNTY44G9.alpha.waypoint.run
```

~> For the initial release, Waypoint creates the preview URL on a HashiCorp service. Because this preview URL is connected to your
application and where it has been deployed, the URL will only show your application when it is running. In this walkthrough,
this means that the Kubernetes cluster and the container for the deployed example NodeJS application must both be running for the URL
to render your application.
