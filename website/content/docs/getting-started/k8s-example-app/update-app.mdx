# Update and Redeploy the Application

One of the most powerful workflows that Waypoint enables is the ability to continuously iterate and redeploy changes to you applications
in a consistent way. Let's demonstrate this by updating a few of the values within the application.

Using your favorite IDE, edit the following file `view/index.ejs` file within the NodeJS directory.

- On line 17 - Edit this line to include a catchy phrase. I prefer a quote from your favorite movie, but hey, live your dream.
  This is about you as the application developer!

Save your file, and re-run the `waypoint up` command

```bash
waypoint up
```

Access the preview URL and observe that your application changes have been reflected in the new version of the deployment.
