# Install Waypoint

-> Review this walkthrough's [prerequisites](/docs/getting-started/k8s-example-app/install-prereqs) before installing Waypoint.

Waypoint uses both a client and a server to build, deploy, and release applications. This functionality is all available from a single binary.

## Download the Binary

To install Waypoint, find the appropriate package on [the releases site](https://go.hashi.co/waypoint-beta-binaries)
for your system and download it as a zip archive.

After downloading Waypoint, unzip the package. Waypoint runs as a single binary named `waypoint`. Any other files in the package can be safely removed and Waypoint will still function.

To make the binary available from anywhere on your system, you can either copy it into `/usr/local/bin` or add it to a different directory in your `PATH`. For instructions on how to do that, see [Editing your Path](#path).

```shell
$ cp ~/Downloads/waypoint /usr/local/bin
```

Validate the installation by running the `waypoint` command.

```
$ waypoint
Usage: waypoint [-version] [-help] [-autocomplete-(un)install] <command> [args]

Common commands:
    release      Release a deployment.
    up           Perform the build, deploy, and release steps for the app.
    build        Build a new versioned artifact from source.
...
```

## Create Kubernetes Secret for Server Image

-> Because Waypoint is currently a pre-release private beta, you need to provide authentication details so that Kubernetes can access the container image containing the binary for running the Waypoint server. Once Waypoint is public, you will not need to do this step.

In order to provide your Kubernetes cluster access to the Waypoint container image during
the private beta, you need to create a Kubernetes secret that contains authentication information
for the GitHub packages repository that hosts the image.

First, you need to [create a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) on GitHub.

-> Note: The Personal Access Token must have `read:packages` permissions to be able to access the Docker repository.

Then, save the token to a file named `TOKEN.txt`. We will read this token when creating the Kubernetes secret. Ensure `kubectl`
is configured to interact with the correct Kubernetes cluster, and then run the following command:

```shell
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry github --docker-server=docker.pkg.github.com --docker-username=GITHUBUSERNAME --docker-password="$(< TOKEN.txt)" --docker-email=GITHUBEMAIL
```

When you run Waypoint install, it defaults to using an image hosted on the GitHub Docker registry.

## Install the Waypoint Server

In this step we will innstall the Waypoint server onto Kubernetes. This allows you to view the user interface, collaborate on deployments, and more.

-> Note: Currently the image for the Waypoint server is hosted in GitHub packages, which does not support containerd. If you are using Kind, or K3d, which uses
containerd rather than DockerD, the Waypoint server install will fail with an ImagePullBackOff error. The Waypoint team is currently working on resolving this issue.

```shell
 $ waypoint install -platform=kubernetes
```

In addition to Kubernetes, the Waypoint server can be installed on Docker or a [Nomad cluster](https://nomadproject.io).
