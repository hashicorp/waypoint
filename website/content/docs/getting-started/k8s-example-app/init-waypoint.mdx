# Initializing Waypoint for Your App

Before you can deploy your application, you must let Waypoint know about its configuration. This is done through the `waypoint.hcl`
file lives within the application directory. Ensure you are in the `waypoint-examples/kubernetes/nodejs/` directory and we can inspect this
`waypoint.hcl` with the following command:

```
cat waypoint.hcl
```

Which should output the following:

```shell
project = "example-nodejs"

  app "example-nodejs" {
    labels = {
      "service" = "example-nodejs",
      "env" = "dev"
    }

    build {
      use "pack" {}
      registry {
          use "docker" {
            image = "nodejs-example"
            tag = "latest"
            local = true
          }
      }
   }

    deploy {
      use "kubernetes" {
      probe_path = "/"
      }
    }

    release {
      use "kubernetes" {
        load_balancer = true
        port = 80
      }
    }
  }
```

The `build` clause defines how Waypoint will build the app. The `pack` option tells Waypoint to use the most relevant Cloud Native
Buildpack to build the application. This application is a NodeJS based application, so ultimately NodeJS Buildpacks will be used.

The `deploy` clause defines where Waypoint will deploy the app. In our case, this is going to Kubernetes

The `release` stanza defines how our application will be released to our environment, in our case we're using a `load_balanacer`
on a specific `port`.

-> Note: You may want to update the `image` entry within the `registry` section to reflect a Docker repository that's externally
accessible if you are using a non-local Kubernetes cluster.

With these configurations in place, execute the following command in order to initialize Waypoint with this configuration.

```bash
$ waypoint init
```
