In this guide, you accomplished the following tasks:

- Initializing an Application against Waypoint
- Deploying our application with the `pack` plugin
- Updating our application to use the `docker` plugin, as well as NodeJS specific and port specific configuration information
- Iterating on the application itself by changing text
- Redeployed our application
- Executing commands with `waypoint exec`
- Viewing log data
- Accessing the UI

We hope this was an enjoyable journey!
