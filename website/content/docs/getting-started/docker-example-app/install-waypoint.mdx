  How to install Waypoint

# Install Waypoint

-> Review this walkthrough's [prerequisites](/docs/getting-started/docker-example-app/install-prereqs) before installing Waypoint.

Waypoint uses both a client and a server to build, deploy, and release applications. This functionality is all available from a single binary.

## Download the Binary

To install Waypoint, find the appropriate package on [the releases site](https://go.hashi.co/waypoint-beta-binaries)
for your system and download it as a zip archive.

After downloading Waypoint, unzip the package. Waypoint runs as a single binary named `waypoint`. Any other files in the package can be safely removed and Waypoint will still function.

To make the binary available from anywhere on your system, you can either copy it into `/usr/local/bin` or add it to a different directory in your `PATH`. For instructions on how to do that, see [Editing your Path](#path).

```
$ cp ~/Downloads/waypoint /usr/local/bin
```

Validate the installation by running the `waypoint` command.

```
$ waypoint
Usage: waypoint [-version] [-help] [-autocomplete-(un)install] <command> [args]

Common commands:
    release      Release a deployment.
    up           Perform the build, deploy, and release steps for the app.
    build        Build a new versioned artifact from source.
...
```

## Pull the Server Image

-> Because Waypoint is currently a pre-release private beta, you need to provide authentication details so that Docker can access the container image that contains the binary for running the Waypoint server. Once Waypoint is public, you will not need to do this step.

First, configure Docker authentication for accessing GitHub packages by [following these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-docker-for-use-with-github-packages#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token).

-> Note: The Personal Access Token must have `read:packages` permissions to be able to access the Docker repository.

Next, create a new Personal Access Token on GitHub, save it to a file, and then login to Docker.

```shell
$ cat ~/TOKEN.txt | docker login https://docker.pkg.github.com -u GITHUBUSERNAME --password-stdin
```

When you run `waypoint install`, Waypoint will uses an image hosted on the GitHub Docker registry by default, and this secret will be used to authenticate to that registry.

Now you need to download the image so that we can start a container with it:

```shell
$ docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/alpha:latest
```

## Install the Waypoint Server

Install the Waypoint server to Docker for Desktop on your computer. This allows you to view the user interface, collaborate on deployments, and more.

```shell
 $ waypoint install -platform=docker
```

You may also install the server to a Kubernetes cluster or a [Nomad cluster](https://nomadproject.io. To learn more about Kubernetes, see the getting started guide for [deploying an app to Kubernetes](/docs/getting-started/k8s-example-app/install-waypoint). The walkthrough shows you how to deploy the server and an example app to Kubernetes.
