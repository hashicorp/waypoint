# Exec into the App Container

Now that you have deployed your app, you can use `waypoint exec` to run commands in the context of the most recent deployment. Typically, `waypoint exec` will be used for running database migrations and debugging; however, you can use it for any purpose.

For example, you can use the command to see what processes the example Ruby app is running.

```shell
$ waypoint exec ps ax
```

Your Terminal output will show the processes running in the Ruby app you most recently deployed.

```shell
# Connected to 01EJCQVA40CG5FC6EGW5PZFC5N
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 ?        Ssl    0:00 /bin/wpceb /cnb/lifecycle/launcher
   14 ?        Sl     0:02 puma 3.11.2 (tcp://0.0.0.0:3000) [workspace]
   22 ?        Sl     0:00 puma: cluster worker 0: 14 [workspace]
   24 ?        Sl     0:00 puma: cluster worker 1: 14 [workspace]
   49 pts/0    Rs+    0:00 /bin/ps ax

```
