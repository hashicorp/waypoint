# Update and Redeploy the App

One of the most powerful parts of Waypoint is its ability to iterate on deployments and quickly redeploy the application with your changes in place.

Open the following file in your preferred development editor:

`app/views/welcome/index.erb`

In the `p` block below the `H1`, update the text to whatever you like and save the file.

```shell
...
    <h1>Welcome to Waypoint: <%= @host %></h1>
    <p> <!-- Edit the text in this block -->
      Congrats on deploying a ruby app using Waypoint. From here you can edit this project and continue to use it to develop your app, if you so wish.
    </p>
...
```

Back in the Terminal, redeploy the application with your new and improved text.

```shell
$ waypoint up
```

Waypoint has now redeployed your application to Docker.

You will notice that the Deployment URL for this second deployment is different from what was created for the first deployment. Waypoint generates unique URLs for each deployment, which means that you can access each deployment by using their unique deployment URLs. This is typically used to preview a deployment before releasing it.

Now, open the new Deployment URL and verify that you see your modified text in the app. Congrats!

-> For Docker deployments currently, both deploys will be active for the non-Deployment specific URL. As such, accessing that URL will return requests from both deployments.
