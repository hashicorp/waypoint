# Access the Browser UI

The Waypoint server includes a browser user interface that allows you to view
builds, deployments, and releases for projects and applications.

### Authenticating

The browser UI requires authentication. Waypoint provides a single
command to automatically open the browser and authenticate your session:

```bash
$ waypoint ui -authenticate
```

-> Waypoint currently utilizes self-signed certificates for TLS. Your browser
will require you to bypass a certificate warning to use the UI.

You can now view the application and associated operations and logs in the browser.
