# `registry` Stanza

<Placement groups={[['app', 'build', 'registry']]} />

The `registry` stanza configures the result of a build to be pushed
to a registry such as a Docker Registry, Artifactory, etc. A registry
is used to make the result of a build available to the deployment platform.

Registries are **optional.** Please see the documentation on the
[registry phase of the Waypoint lifecycle](/docs/lifecycle/build#registry)
for examples of when a registry is necessary and the behavior of Waypoint
without a registry specified.

```hcl
app "frontend" {
  build {
    use "docker" {}

    registry {
      use "docker" {
        image = "example.com/my-app"
        tag   = gitrefpretty()
      }

      hook {
        # ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```
