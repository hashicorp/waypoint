# `config` Stanza

<Placement groups={[['config'], ['app', 'config']]} />

The `config` stanza configures [application configuration](/docs/app-config).
Application configuration sets environment variables for your application
that is either statically set or synced with an external system.
Application configuration can be set via the `waypoint.hcl` file using
the `config` stanza as well as via the [CLI](/commands/config-set).

-> **To learn about application configuration more broadly** please also read the
[application configuration](/docs/app-config) docs. The dedicated application
configuration section goes into more detail about how application configuration
works with Waypoint. This page is specifically about the `config` stanza
in the `waypoint.hcl` file and _does not_ cover the application configuration
system more broadly.

## Project vs. App Scope

The `config` stanza can appear at the project (root) level or within
an `app`. Configuration set at the project level is used for all applications
and merged with any app-scoped configuration. Configuration set within an
`app` stanza is only set for that application. If there are any conflicting
values, the app-scoped value overrides the project-scoped value.

The example below shows configuration set at both the project and app scope.
In this case, these will be merged and the app will have both the `THEME`
and `PORT` environment variables set.

```hcl
config {
  env = {
    THEME = "rainbow"
  }
}

app "frontend" {
  config {
    env = {
      PORT = 8080
    }
  }

  # ...
}
```

## Syncing

Changes to `config` in the `waypoint.hcl` file take effect only during
the scenarios listed below:

1. `waypoint up` - A full build, deploy, release will resync configuration.
1. `waypoint deploy` - This is useful when you want to redeploy but don't
   want to rebuild the application.
1. `waypoint config sync` - This is useful when you want to update the
   configuration but don't want to redeploy the application.

When the configuration is synced, any values set in the file will overwrite
values that may have been set manually via the CLI. Any configuration set in the CLI
that was not set in the configuration file will remain unchanged.

Synced configuration impacts _all_ versions of a deployed application. All
deployed applications will subsequently be restarted if configuration values
changed.

## `config` Parameters

### Optional

- `env` `(map<string>ConfigValue: {})` - Environment variables to set
  for the deployed application. See the `ConfigValue` section below on more
  details on valid values for this map.

## `ConfigValue`

A `ConfigValue` type is used to configure the value of a configuration key
such as within `env`.

### Primitive Values

A configuration value can be set to a primitive value such as a string
or number. This will be coerced into a string and set as a static configuration
value. In the example below, we set the `PORT` environment variable using
a static value:

```hcl
config {
  env = {
    PORT = 8080
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Value

A configuration value can be synced with an external system using the
`configdynamic` function. This function can only be used within a `config`
stanza and creates a `ConfigValue`. In the example below, we synchronize
a value with a Kubernetes ConfigMap:

```hcl
config {
  env = {
    PORT = configdynamic("kubernetes", {
      name = "my-app" # ConfigMap name
      key  = "port"
    })
  }
}
```
