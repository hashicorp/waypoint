# `use` Stanza

<Placement
  groups={[
    ['app', 'build', 'use'],
    ['app', 'build', 'registry', 'use'],
    ['app', 'deploy', 'use'],
    ['app', 'release', 'use'],
  ]}

The `use` stanza specifies the name and configuration of a plugin to use for
an operation. The type of plugin depends on the context of the `use` stanza.
For example: a `use` stanza within a `build` configures the builder plugin
to use.

```hcl
app "frontend" {
  build {
    use "docker" {
      buildkit = true
    }
  }

  # ...
}
```

## `use` Parameters

### Label

The `use` stanza takes a label. The label of the stanza is the name
of the plugin to use.

The plugin name must match the name of a [built-in plugin](/waypoint/integrations?flags=builtin)
or an [external plugin](/waypoint/docs/plugins). The plugin will be validated as part of
the `waypoint init` process.

### Parameters

The parameters of a `use` stanza are defined by the plugin being used.
You must look at the documentation of the plugin you're using to determine
the available configuration options.

As an example, if you were using the Docker builder you could find
the available parameters [documented here](/waypoint/integrations/hashicorp/docker/latest/components/builder#parameters).
