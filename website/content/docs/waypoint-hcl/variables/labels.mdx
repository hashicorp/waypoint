# `labels` Variable

<Placement

    ['app', 'deploy'],
    ['app', 'release'],
  ]}

The `labels` variable is a map of the full set of labels that are
set for the current operation.

### Example: Kubernetes Annotations

The example below shows how we can set annotations on a Kubernetes
deployment to mirror the Waypoint labels we have set.

```hcl
app "web" {
  deploy {
    use "kubernetes" {
      annotations = { for k, v in labels: "waypoint/${k}" => v }
    }
  }
}
```

This examples goes a bit further and uses HCL map expressions to
prefix all our labels with "waypoint/" to note they come from Waypoint.
If you wanted to just map the labels directly, you can do
`annotations = labels` directly.

### Example: Conditional on Labels

The example below shows how we can use the `selectormatch` function
to perform conditional logic with labels. The `selector`-prefixed functions
all use the common label selector syntax that is used throughout various
features in Waypoint.

```hcl
app "web" {
  deploy {
    use "kubernetes" {
      image_secret = selectormatch(labels, "env == production") ?
        "ProdSecret" : "DevSecret"
    }
  }
}
```

This could also be done with `selectorlookup` which allows mapping
matching selector expressions to specific values:

```hcl
app "web" {
  deploy {
    use "kubernetes" {
      image_secret = selectorlookup(labels, {
        "env == production" = "ProdSecret"
      }, "DevSecret")
    }
  }
}
```
