# Variables in `waypoint.hcl`

The `waypoint.hcl` file uses [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) which
is able to reference predefined variables. This section will document the
list of available variables within the `waypoint.hcl`. Variable documentation
pages use [placement tables](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl#placement-tables)
to document where variables are valid.

## Using Variables

Variable usage is similar to many mainstream programming languages such
as Javascript, Ruby, or Python. Variables can be used directly, such as
in the example below where `path.app` is assigned to `dockerfile`.

```hcl
dockerfile = path.app
```

Variables can also be interpolated in strings to concatenate multiple
values together:

```hcl
dockerfile = "${path.app}/Dockerfile"
```

## Custom Variables

Waypoint supports [custom input variables](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/input), predefined
variables, and the dynamic variables introduced by plugins, such as
[`artifact`](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/artifact).
