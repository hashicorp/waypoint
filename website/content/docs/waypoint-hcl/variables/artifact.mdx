# `artifact` Variable

<Placement

    ['app', 'release'],

The `artifact` variable can be used to reference information about
built artifacts. This can be used to access information such as
the name and tag of a built Docker image, or the AMI of a built
EC2 machine image.

The exact fields within an `artifact` variable are dependent on the
[plugin used for the build](/waypoint/integrations) and the available fields are
documented alongside plugins.

## Example: Docker

The example below uses the `artifact` variable to reuse the
Docker image name from the build when pushing it to a registry. This
configuration makes it so that if the build name is changed, it will
also automatically change for the registry without having to modify
the configuration.

```hcl
app "web" {
  build {
    use "docker" {}

    registry {
      use "docker" {
        image = artifact.image
        tag = gitrefpretty()
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The example uses the `artifact.image` value which is the image name
(without a tag). Other fields such as `artifact.tag` and
`artifact.name` (the full name with the tag) are also available.
For the full list of available fields, see the Docker plugin documentation.
