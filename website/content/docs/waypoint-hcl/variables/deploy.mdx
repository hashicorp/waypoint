# `deploy` Variable

<Placement groups={[['app', 'release']]} />

The `deploy` variable can be used to reference information about
the deployment within a release. This can be used to access information
such as the resulting instance ID, IP address, etc.

The exact fields within a `deploy` variable are dependent on the
[plugin used for the build](/plugins) and the available fields are
documented alongside plugins.

## Example: AWS ECS

The example below uses the `deploy` variable to store the ECS Task ARN
as a label as part of the release operation. While Waypoint keeps track
of the backlinks of what deployment created a release, this information
may be useful to have directly in a label:

```hcl
app "web" {
  deploy {
    use "aws-ecs" {
      # ...
    }
  }

  release {
    labels = {
      "example.com/task-arn": deploy.task_arn,
    }

    use "aws-ecs" {
      # ...
    }
  }
}
```
