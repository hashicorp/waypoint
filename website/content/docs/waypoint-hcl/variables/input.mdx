# Input Variables

Input variables let you customize aspects of Waypoint configuration with values
that may change, or that need to be set per Waypoint run.

You can parameterize your configuration by declaring variables in the
waypoint.hcl file, and setting their values using CLI options, environment variables,
`auto` files, and the Waypoint server UI.

## Declaring an Input Variable

Each input variable referenced in the waypoint.hcl file must be declared using a
[`variable` block](/docs/waypoint-hcl/variable). Example variable declaration
blocks include:

```hcl
variable "port" {
  type    = number
  default = 8080
}

variable "image_name" {
  type    = string
  default = "latest"
}

variable "docker_labels" {
  type = object({
    environment = string
    log_level   = string
  })
  default = {
      environment = test
      log_level   = debug
  }
}
```

The label after the `variable` keyword is a name for the variable, which must
be unique among all variables in the same waypoint.hcl file. This name is used
to assign a value to the variable and to reference the variable's value when
evaluating the configuration.

The name of a variable can be any valid [identifier](/docs/waypoint-hcl/syntax#identifiers).

## Arguments

Waypoint CLI defines the following optional arguments for variable declarations:

- [`default`][inpage-default] - A default value.
- [`type`][inpage-type] - This specifies what value types are accepted for the variable.
- [`description`][inpage-description] - This specifies the input variable's documentation.

### Default values

[inpage-default]: #default-values

The variable declaration can include a `default` argument. If present, the
default value will be used if no value is set when running Waypoint. The
`default` argument requires a literal value and cannot reference functions or
other objects in the configuration. The default value can be `null`.

A default value of `null` can useful when you want to initialize a project
with variables you intend to define just-in-time, such as via a -var flag on
the command line. `waypoint init` will fail to initialize plugins that rely
on variables with no defined value. While a `null` value in a given stage
will not be valid when the receiving field needs to evaluate the value
it is a fine placeholder for initializing a project.

This also allows for variables that are not used in all stanzas to be
indicated as optional values.

For example, given the below waypoint.hcl file, you could run `waypoint build`
without needing to pass in a value for the `port` variable. If you ran
`waypoint up` or `waypoint deploy` without specifying a value, you would
receive an error.

```hcl
app "my-app" {
  build {
    use "docker" {}
  }

  deploy {
    use "docker" {
      service_port = var.port
    }
  }
}

variable "port" {
  type    = number
  default = null
}

```

### Type Constraints

[inpage-type]: #type-constraints

The `type` argument in a `variable` block allows you to restrict the
[type of value](/docs/waypoint-hcl/syntax/expressions#types-and-values) that
will be accepted as the value for a variable.

While type constraints are optional, we recommend specifying them; they
can serve as helpful reminders for users of the module, and they
allow Waypoint to return a helpful error message if the wrong type is used.

Type constraints are created from a mixture of type keywords and type
constructors. The supported type keywords are:

- `string`
- `number`
- `bool`

The type constructors allow you to specify complex types such as
collections:

- `list(<TYPE>)`
- `set(<TYPE>)`
- `map(<TYPE>)`
- `object({<ATTR NAME> = <TYPE>, ... })`
- `tuple([<TYPE>, ...])`

If both the `type` and `default` arguments are specified, the given default
value must be convertible to the specified type.

If no type constraint is set then a type will be inferred from the `default`
value.

If neither `type` nor `default` is set, then the value type will be
evaluated as follows:

- A value supplied from an environment variable or a CLI flag will be evaluated
  as a `string`.
- A value supplied from a wpvars file will be evaluated as one of the three
  primitive types, `string`, `number`, or `bool`, based on syntax.
- A value supplied from the UI will be evaluated as either a `string` or HCL
  type constructor, dependent on if the HCL option is selected.

### Input Variable Documentation

[inpage-description]: #input-variable-documentation

To aid in documentation of what defined variables are expected to be used for,
you can briefly describe the purpose of each variable using the optional
`description` argument:

```hcl
variable "image_tag" {
  type        = string
  description = "The tag assigned to built Docker images."
}
```

The description should concisely explain the purpose of the variable and what
kind of value is expected.

## Using Input Variable Values

Within the waypoint.hcl file that declared a variable, its value can be accessed
from within [expressions](/docs/waypoint-hcl/syntax/expressions) as
`var.<NAME>`, where `<NAME>` matches the label given in the declaration block:

-> **Note:** Input variables are _created_ by a `variable` block, but you
_reference_ them as attributes on an object named `var`.

```hcl
  deploy {
    use "docker" {
      service_port = var.port
    }
  }
```

The value assigned to a variable can only be accessed within the `app` stanza.
[Top-level parameters](/docs/waypoint-hcl#top-level-parameters), such as the
project or app names, cannot reference variable values.

## Assigning Values to Custom Input Variables

When variables are declared in your configuration, they can be set in a
number of ways. Waypoint loads variables in the following order, with
later sources taking precedence over earlier ones:

- In the project settings via [the Waypoint server's UI](https://www.waypointproject.io/docs/server#waypoint-server).
- Automatically loaded variable definition files, named with the pattern
  `*.auto.wpvars`.
- As environment variables.
- In variable definitions (`.wpvars`) files specified with the `-var-file` command
  line option.
- Individually, with the `-var` command line option.

The following sections describe these options in more detail.

### Variables on the Command Line

To specify individual variables on the command line, use the `-var` option
when running the `waypoint up` or specific stage commands (e.g. `waypoint build`).
You can use the `-var` option multiple times in a single command to set several
different variables.

```
waypoint up -var="port=8080"
waypoint up -var='networks=["internal","dev-test"]' -var="port=8080"
waypoint up -var='network_map={"internal":8080,"dev-test":9701}'
```

The above examples show appropriate syntax for Unix-style shells, such as on
Linux or macOS.
If you're on Windows, we recommend using the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe).
When you pass a variable value to Waypoint from the Windows Command Prompt,
use double quotes " around the argument:

```
waypoint up -var "name=value"
```

If your intended value includes literal double quotes then you'll need to
escape those with a backslash:

```
waypoint up -var "name=va\"lue"
```

### Variable Definitions (`.wpvars`) Files

To set lots of variables, it is more convenient to specify their values in
a _variable definitions file_ (with a filename ending in either `.wpvars`
or `.wpvars.json`) and then specify that file on the command line with
`-var-file`:

```
waypoint up -var-file="testing.wpvars"
```

A variable definitions file uses the same basic syntax as Waypoint language
files, but consists only of variable name assignments:

```hcl
port = "8080"
networks = [
  "internal",
  "dev-test",
]
```

Waypoint also automatically loads any `auto` variable definitions files - files
with names ending in `.auto.wpvars` or `.auto.wpvars.json` - if they are present.

Files whose names end with `.json` are parsed instead as JSON objects, with
the root object properties corresponding to variable names:

```json
{
  "port": 8080,
  "networks": ["internal", "dev-test"]
}
```

### Environment Variables

As a fallback for the other ways of defining variables, Waypoint searches
the environment of its own process for environment variables named `WP_VAR_`
followed by the name of a declared variable.

This can be useful when running Waypoint in automation, or when running a
sequence of Waypoint commands in succession with the same variables.
For example, at a `bash` prompt on a Unix system:

```
$ export WP_VAR_port=8080
$ waypoint up
...
```

On operating systems where environment variable names are case-sensitive,
Waypoint matches the variable name exactly as given in configuration, and
so the required environment variable name will usually have a mix of upper
and lower case letters as in the above example.

### Variables in the UI

To assign variable values in the UI, navigate to the Project Settings page and
then to the Input Variables tab.

![input-variables-settings](/img/input-vars-empty-settings-tab.png)

Add new variables using the variable name as the `key`, and the value you
wish to assign as the `value`. All non-HCL values will be evaluated as strings,
and values with the `HCL` box selected will be evaluated as a
[complex type][inpage-complex-types].

![input-variables-settings](/img/input-vars-add-variable-dialog.png)

All values will then be converted to the `type` specified in the corresponding
`variable` definition block in the waypoint.hcl file.
If the value cannot be converted to this type (or, if `type` is unset, the
implicit type of the `default` value), you will receive an error.

### Complex-typed Values

[inpage-complex-types]: #complex-types

When variable values are provided in a variable definitions file, you can use
Waypoint's usual syntax for
[literal expressions](/docs/language/expressions/types.html#literal-expressions)
to assign complex-typed values, like lists and maps.

Some special rules apply to the `-var` command line option and to environment
variables. For convenience, Waypoint defaults to interpreting `-var` and
environment variable values as literal strings, which need only shell quoting,
and no special quoting for Waypoint. For example, in a Unix-style shell:

```
$ export WP_VAR_port=8080
```

However, if a root module variable uses a [type constraint](#type-constraints)
to require a complex value (list, set, map, object, or tuple), Waypoint will
instead attempt to parse its value using the same syntax used within variable
definitions files, which requires careful attention to the string escaping rules
in your shell:

```
$ export TF_VAR_networks='["internal","dev-test"]'
```

For readability, and to avoid the need to worry about shell escaping, we
recommend always setting complex variable values via variable definitions files.

### Values for Undeclared Variables

If you have defined a variable value, but not its corresponding `variable {}`
definition in the waypoint.hcl file, you will get an error.

To avoid this error, either declare a variable block for the value, or remove
the variable value from your Waypoint call.

### Variable Definition Precedence

The above mechanisms for setting variables can be used together in any
combination. If the same variable is assigned multiple values, Waypoint uses
the _last_ value it finds, overriding any previous values. Note that the same
variable cannot be assigned multiple values within a single source. Doing so
will result in an error.

Waypoint loads variables in the following order, with later sources taking
precedence over earlier ones:

- In the project settings via [the Waypoint server's UI](https://www.waypointproject.io/docs/server#waypoint-server).
- Automatically loaded variable definition files, named with the pattern
  `*.auto.wpvars`.
- From environment variables prefixed with `WP_VAR_`.
- In variable definitions files (e.g. `dev.wpvars`) specified with the
  `-var-file` command line option.
- Individually, with the `-var` command line option.
