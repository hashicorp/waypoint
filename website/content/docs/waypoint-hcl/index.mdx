# Project Configuration: `waypoint.hcl`

The `waypoint.hcl` file is used to configure each Waypoint project. It defines
how Waypoint builds, deploys, and releases a project. The `waypoint.hcl` file is
written in [HCL](/docs/waypoint-hcl/syntax) or [JSON](/docs/waypoint-hcl/syntax/json),
allowing both human and machine friendly formats.

Waypoint expects one `waypoint.hcl` per [project](/docs/glossary#project) or
version control repository. The `waypoint.hcl` file is supposed to be committed
to version control. This allows multiple team members to share the same Waypoint
behavior and also provides a history of change in how an application is deployed.

The `waypoint.hcl` file is typically placed at the root of a version control
repository. To deploy multiple applications, defined each with an [`app`][app]
stanza. Each application should live in subdirectories of the project.

When executing the `waypoint` CLI, it will search for the `waypoint.hcl` file
in the current directory, followed by each subsequent parent directory.

## Template `waypoint.hcl`

```hcl
project = "project-name"

app "app-name" {
  path = "./src"

  build {
    # ...
  }

  deploy {
    # ...
  }

  release {
    # ...
  }

plugin "plugin-name" {

}
```

## Placement Tables

Many pages within the `waypoint.hcl` documentation section will have
a _placement table_ just beneath the header. This table documents where
a configuration, function, or variable may be used. An example placement
table is shown below.

If the example below were present on the documentation page, the documented
feature is only valid within the context of an `app` stanza. It is not valid
at the top-level, or any further nested locations.

<Placement groups={[['app', 'build']]} />

## Top-level

The "top-level" refers to the objects that are not nested in any other
configuration. The top-level is made of "stanzas" and "parameters".

## Stanzas and Parameters

A "stanza" is an block of code that opens and closes with braces `{ }`
and may contain more configuration parameters. Above, `app "app-name" {}` is
the `app` stanza.

A "parameter" is the term used to describe any configuration object. `build`
and `path` are parameters of `app`. `project`, `app "app-name"`, and `plugin`
are parameters of the top-level.

Several "common" parameters can be used in stanzas. These are `use` and `hook`.
These can not be top-level parameters, but are available in `build`, `deploy`,
and `release`. These are documented further in their respective pages.

A stanza is a parameter, but not all parameters are stanzas.

## Variables

Waypoint configuration files have access to a number of predefined variables.
Using variables helps make a Waypoint configuration more robust by more
explicitly specifying paths, reducing duplication, etc. You can learn more about
variables in the dedicated [variables section](/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables).

## Top-level Parameters

### Required

- `app` <code>([app][app])</code> - One or more applications to build, deploy,
  and release with Waypoint.

- `project` `(string)` - The name of the project. This should be unique
  for the Waypoint server and must not be changed later. This is used to
  organize information on the server.

~> **Warning: the project name can not be changed.** Changing the project
name is not currently supported. If you change the name, the history,
deployments, etc. of the previous project name will not be migrated or destroyed.
A future version of Waypoint will enable renaming projects.

### Optional

- `plugin` <code>([plugin][plugin])</code> - External plugins that may be
  used in this configuration. Plugins are implicitly defined with
  [`use`](/docs/waypoint-hcl/use) stanzas so this is only required if you
  need to additionally configure a plugin.
