# Full Function Reference

This page contains an automatically generated list of all the available
functions within the Waypoint configuration file. To navigate this page
more easily, we recommend using your browser's find feature
(`Cmd-F` or `Ctrl-F`) along with the "Jump to Section" dropdown above.

-> **Note:** This page is currently missing some functions such as
the template functions (`templatedir`, etc.) and configuration functions
(`configdynamic`). We are working to fix this. In the meantime, these
functions are documented elsewhere in context with their purpose.
