# `release` Stanza

<Placement groups={[['app', 'release']]} />

traffic. This step may involve adding a deployment to a load balancer, updating
DNS, configuring a service mesh, etc.

Release configuration is **optional.** Please see the documentation on the
[release phase of the Waypoint lifecycle](/waypoint/docs/lifecycle/release)
for the Waypoint behavior when a release phase is not configured.

app "frontend" {
  build {
    use "docker" {}

    registry {
      # ...
    }
  }

  deploy {
    use "kubernetes" {}

    hook {
      # ...
    }
  }

  release {
    use "aws-alb" {}

    hook {
      # ...
    }
  }
# ...
}
```
