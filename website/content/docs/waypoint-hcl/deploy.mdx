# `deploy` Stanza

<Placement groups={[['app', 'deploy']]} />

The `deploy` stanza describes how an application is deployed.
A deploy takes a previously built artifact and stages it onto the target
deployment platform. The target deployment platform is pluggable and can be
Docker, Kubernetes, Nomad, EC2, and more.

Exactly one `deploy` stanza is required within an application.

```hcl
app "frontend" {
  deploy {
    use "kubernetes" {}

    hook {
      # ...
    }
  }

  # ...
}
```

## `deploy` Parameters

### Required

- `use` <code>([use][use])</code> - The plugin to use for deploying the
  application. For example, the "kubernetes" plugin will create a deployment
  within Kubernetes.

### Optional

- `hook` <code>([hook][hook]: nil)</code> - [Hooks](/docs/lifecycle/hooks)
  to execute before and/or after the deploy.
