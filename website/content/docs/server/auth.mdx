# Server Authentication

All connections to the Waypoint server via the CLI or UI require an
auth token to authenticate.

If you're a new user that ran `waypoint install`, the auth token was automatically
configured for your local CLI.

## Using Your Token

### CLI

To use the token with the CLI, the preferred way is to persist it with
a context using `waypoint context create`. This will store the token in
your home directory and make it always available when using Waypoint.

You may also set the token at any time using the `WAYPOINT_TOKEN`
environment variable. This will override any context settings.

### UI

When you first visit the Waypoint UI, you will be asked to enter a token.
Enter your token to authenticate. The UI will save this token in your browser's
local storage.

## Invite

If you're inviting other users to access your Waypoint server, you should
generate an invite token. An invite token is a special type of token that
can be exchanged exactly once for a real auth token. To generate an invite
token, you can use the "Invite" link in the UI or the CLI;

```shell-session
$ waypoint token invite
svESKuVYKeLkgFP3heNanrhvwiMfxfM7q7d3m8UTU3fTDwetfq9vMsBtdqeRmKakXZXJjLDinApxkDcVe594vR2FfVeF3m6gupZ8NVcSC
```

The receiving user can exchange this token using the UI or using
`waypoint token exchange`.

## Generate

If you're creating a new token for yourself, you can generate a new
auth token directly:

```shell-session
$ waypoint token new
svESKuVYKeLkgFP3heNanrhvwiMfxfM7q7d3m8UTU3fTDwetfq9vMsBtdqeRmKakXZXJjLDinApxkDcVe594vR2FfVeF3m6gupZ8NVcSC
```

## Revoke, Inspect, etc.

Waypoint currently doesn't have any mechanism to revoke tokens,
audit token usage, inspect an existing token, etc. We plan on expanding
our token system to support this in the future.
