# Externally Built Images

The Waypoint workflow includes the ability to perform the
[build](/waypoint/docs/lifecycle/build) step directly, but users may also use Waypoint with
externally built artifacts such as from CI pipelines. This is particularly
common if you're adopting Waypoint for existing applications (versus
net new use cases).

## Configuring Waypoint to Use an Existing Image

The [docker-pull builder](/waypoint/plugins/docker#docker-pull-builder) was designed
so that Waypoint can use pre-built Docker images. These images can be built
anyway you want: manually, CI pipelines, 3rd party sources, etc.

The example below shows how we can use an image that was already built.
In this case, Waypoint does nothing: it just notes that this is the image
you want to use. It doesn't verify that it can access this image and
doesn't modify the image in any way. This enables the `deploy` plugin in
the next step to use this pre-existing image.

```hcl
build {
  use "docker-pull" {
    image = "gcr.io/my-project/my-image"
    tag   = "abcd1234"
    disable_entrypoint = true
  }
}
```

A more realistic example would likely use
[input variables](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/input)
or [functions](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/functions/all) to dynamically specify
the correct image.

-> **Why `disable_entrypoint`?** Waypoint doesn't currently support
entrypoint injection for the `docker-pull` builder on Kubernetes runners.
See the [entrypoint injection](#waypoint-entrypoint-with-external-image-builds)
section on this page for how you can manually inject the entrypoint.

### Input Variables to Specify the Image Tag

[Input variables](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/input) can be used
to specify parameters for configuring the image to use, as shown below.
This is a more realistic example because this allows a step in a system
such as a CI to specify to Waypoint what the desired image tag is for deployment.

```hcl
variable "image_tag" {
  type = string
}

app "my-app" {
  build {
    use "docker-pull" {
      image = "gcr.io/my-project/my-image"
      tag   = var.image_tag
      disable_entrypoint = true
    }
  }
}
```

This variable can then be used in [many ways](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/input#assigning-values-to-custom-input-variables).
If a CI is executing Waypoint, the most likely way is via a flag:

```shell-session
$ waypoint build -var image_tag=$TAG my-project/my-app
```

-> **Note:** The `<project>/<app>` syntax with `waypoint` CLI operations forces
a [remote operation](/waypoint/docs/projects/remote). This can be invoked anywhere;
`waypoint` does not need the project source to be available in the local filesystem, only credentials to
access the Waypoint server.

### Git Functions to Specify the Image Tag

Another approach to specifying the image tag, particularly in a GitOps-oriented
workflow, would be to use [Git functions](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/functions/all#gitrefhash).

The example below specifies that the tag should always match the current
Git commit hash. This assumes your external system is building an image for
every commit. You can also use functions such as `gitreftag` to get the
current tag.

```hcl
app "my-app" {
  build {
    use "docker-pull" {
      image = "gcr.io/my-project/my-image"
      tag   = gitrefhash()
      disable_entrypoint = true
    }
  }
}
```

## Invoking Waypoint when Using External Images

When using externally built images, Waypoint should be invoked after the
image is already created. The approach to do this depends on how your build
system is configured and how (or if) your team uses Git.

### Invoking from CI

The first approach is to _not use_ [repository polling](/waypoint/docs/projects/git#polling)
with Waypoint, because Waypoint may run before your CI system builds the image.
Instead, the CI system can manually invoke the Waypoint operation once the
image is built.

To do this, the CI must be configured with
[connection environment variables](/waypoint/docs/automating-execution#environment-variables):
`WAYPOINT_SERVER_ADDR`, `WAYPOINT_SERVER_TOKEN`, etc. Then, after the
image is built, trigger a deploy:

```shell-session
$ waypoint up <project>/<app>
```

You may specify variables and other flags to the `up` command. The `<project>/<app>`
syntax will force a [remote operation](/waypoint/docs/projects/remote) so the up will
happen remotely. This will block while the operation is happening.

### Invoking from Git

Another approach is to continue using Git to trigger deploys. In this
approach, your [project Git settings](/waypoint/docs/projects/git) should be configured
to watch a specific branch that is only merged to when you're ready to deploy.

For example, you can have a `production` branch (or it may just be your main
branch) that you only merge to _after_ your CI system ran tests and built
the resulting image.

This requires a different style of Git discipline and may not fit all teams.

## Waypoint Entrypoint with External Image Builds

The [Waypoint Entrypoint](/waypoint/docs/entrypoint) is an optional component that enables
features such as `waypoint exec`, log streaming, instance tracking, and more.
When using externally built Docker images, you must also manually inject
the entrypoint.
This is **optional**! Waypoint does not require the entrypoint to perform
deploys.

To setup the entrypoint, the simplest approach is to use
[Docker multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/):

```dockerfile
FROM hashicorp/waypoint:latest AS waypoint

# Your main build:
FROM yourbaseimage

COPY --from=waypoint /usr/bin/waypoint-entrypoint /waypoint-entrypoint

# Replace "<EXISTING>" with your existing entrypoint (if any)
ENTRYPOINT ["/waypoint-entrypoint", <EXISTING>]
```

Note that injecting the entrypoint is safe _even if you don't use Waypoint_.
If the entrypoint doesn't have the proper environment variables set
(by Waypoint itself, not as part of the build), then the entrypoints acts
as if it doesn't exist: it executes its child process and does nothing.
This lets you start injecting the entrypoint even if you're still only
experimenting with Waypoint.
