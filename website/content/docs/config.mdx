# Application Configuration

Waypoint can configure your application via environment variables
via the CLI using `waypoint config`.

Applications often take configuration such as database URLs, ports to
listen on, etc. in the form of environment variables. Using `waypoint config`,
you can set these variables and Waypoint will automatically make them
available to your application.

This functionality requires the [Waypoint entrypoint](/docs/entrypoint).

## Setting Configuration

Configuration can be set using `waypoint config set`.

```
$ waypoint config set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://example.com:5432"
```

This will make the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable present with the
given value for all deployed applications.

-> **Waypoint currently will not restart your application when configuration
changes.** Configuration changes will only take effect when you redeploy
your application. A future version of Waypoint will restart deployed
applications.

### Project Scope

`waypoint config set` will set variables by default scoped to the _project_.
This means that all applications within your project will have the environment
variable set.

### Application Scope

You may use the `-app` flag to scope a variable to a specific application.
For this scope, only a specific application in the project will have the
configuration set.

```
$ waypoint config set -app web PORT=8080
```

## Unsetting Configuration

To delete a configuration variable, set it to the empty string.
