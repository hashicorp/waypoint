# Exec

Waypoint enables you to execute commands in the context of a deployed application.
This can be used to open up a shell for debugging, execute database migrations,
and more.

This functionality requires the [Waypoint entrypoint](/docs/entrypoint).

## Using the CLI

The `waypoint exec` command can be used to execute a command in the context
of a deployed application. The example below shows exec being used to open a
shell:

```shell-session
$ waypoint exec bash
# echo foo
foo
```

This is useful for debugging a deployment that may not be behaving as
expected. You can also run one-off commands that aren't interactive:

```shell-session
$ waypoint exec rake db:migrate
...
```

This is useful for executing scripts in the context of the application
environment. This makes things like environment variables and other secrets
typically available.

If `waypoint exec` is called in an interactive terminal (versus a script),
information about your terminal will be sent to the remote end. This enables
tools like `vim` or other terminal UIs to work as normal. Waypoint also
sends terminal resize events so everything should behave correctly even as you
resize your terminal.

## Target Environment

`waypoint exec` works by picking a random running instance of the latest
deployment and executing within that environment. **Exec does not spin up
a new dedicated instance.** Please keep this in mind if you need to run
resource intensive tasks since user traffic may be sharing the same instance.

-> A future version of Waypoint will enable targeting specific deployments
and instances. We will also enable an option to deploy a special exec-only
instance so resources aren't shared.
