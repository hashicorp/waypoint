# Waypoint Roadmap

Waypoint is a new project and we have a lot we want to achieve with it.
This page will outline some of the ideas we have for future versions of Waypoint.
This is not an exhaustive list nor is it a promise that these features will
be built, but it gives a glimpse in the vision we have for this project.

For a finer-grained view into our roadmap and what is being worked on for
a release, please refer to the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues).
This is a more manual approach to reading our roadmap and includes small details
such as bug fixes, but is much more accurate to what we're working on.

### Server Production Readiness Improvements

The initial Waypoint releases have a minimal featureset around running the Waypoint server.
We plan to improve the `waypoint install` and `waypoint server run` interfaces
to support more options, such as custom TLS certs.

### Access Control

The initial Waypoint release has a minimal token system that is used as a
blanket authorization mechanism. In the future we will add a more fine-grained
access control mechanism to Waypoint.

One exception to this today are Entrypoint tokens. The Entrypoint uses
a special fine-grained token that allows it to only access entrypoint-related
functionality for the specific deployment it represents. This was built as
a special security mechanism however and isn't generally available to limit
access for other tokens.

### Service Brokering (Databases, Queues, etc.)

We plan on having some mechanism by which applications can request services
such as databases, queues, and so on. These services must be satisfied by
some external system such as Amazon RDS. Waypoint will be able to request
the service, connect the configuration, and destroy it when its no longer
in use.

A design goal of Waypoint is explicitly to _not do automated infrastructure
management_, so this feature will still put the burden of managing these
services onto the user. However, Waypoint can help orchestrate initializing
them and configuring applications.

We will likely integrate with [Terraform](https://terraform.io) in some way.

### App Promotion

Waypoint initially has the [workspaces](/docs/workspaces) feature for
isolating different environments. This is a working but minimal feature
targeted towards this use case.

We plan on building on this feature to enable workspaces that may target
different infrastructures (such as a dev vs. production cluster) and we
want to build features so applications can be easily "promoted" from
one stage to another.

### Exec Improvements

We're really excited about [`waypoint exec`](/docs/exec) but there
are a lot of improvements we want to make here:

- **New deployment targeting.** - We want exec to be able to spin up
  new exec-focused deployments so that your exec sessions aren't shared with
  deployments that might be receiving user traffic. Additionally, this will
  let us harden security by disabling exec in most deployments.

- **Better security, specifically around disabling.** - We want exec to
  be safe. One mechanism towards that is having exec be disabled
  as often as possible but can still easily be used when needed. We think having exec
  disabled by default paired with the above deployment targeting feature makes
  this a reality.

- **Native exec.** - If a platform provides a native `exec` feature, we
  want to provide that as an option to users. This is always likely to not
  be a default because we want the consistent option as the default.

### Remote Runners

We will enable the ability for operation execution (build, deploy, etc.)
to happen remotely. The CLI can still kick off operations but operations will
happen on a remote machine.

The foundation for this and initially implementations are actually already
in the initial versions of Waypoint. But we didn't feel confident in the
implementation yet and we didn't feel we completed the story here to properly
document and advertise this functionality.

Remote runners will enable more advanced workflows and improve security
since access credentials can be encapsulated onto remote machines. The runners
are expected to be run by the individual (not a hosted service). Runners also
better enable Slack and other integrations.

We will continue building on this and release this in the future.

### Slack

We want to enable a "ChatOps" style interface to Waypoint. We spiked
an experiment where we got this working and it is committed to the source
currently under the `x/` directory (for "experimental").

In the end, we felt this experience wasn't quite ready for the initial Waypoint
release but we will enable this workflow.
