# Release

A release activates a previously staged
[deployment](/docs/lifecycle/deploy)
and opens it
to general traffic. This step may involve adding a deployment to a load balancer,
updating DNS, configuring a service mesh, etc.

**The release stage is optional.** See [default behavior](/docs/lifecycle/release#default-behavior)
for more information.

## Configuration

The release is configured using the `release` stanza within an `app`.
This section is optional. If it isn't specified, each deployment is assumed
to be released.

```hcl
app "my-app" {
  release {
    use "aws-alb" {}
  }
}
```

## Default Behavior

If the release stage is not specified,
two different behaviors may occur depending on if the deployment platform
being used supports a default releaser.

### Platform Default Releaser

The deployment platform being used may support what is called a "default
releaser". This means the deployment platform has default release behavior
if an explicit release stage isn't specified. For example, the Kubernetes
platform supports a default releaser that creates a `Service` resource.

In this case, the default releaser will be used automatically if no
`release` configuration is explicitly available in the Waypoint project
configuration file.

### No Releaser

If no default releaser exists for the deployment platform and no
release is configured in the Waypoint project configuration, then each
deploy is expected to already be released.

This behavior matches how deploys may have been considered in the past:
you deploy and it is immediately available to consumers of your application.

In this scenario, it is expected that either the deployment platform makes
the deployments available to traffic or this is handled externally.
