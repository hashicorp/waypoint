# Release

A release activates a previously staged
[deployment](/waypoint/docs/lifecycle/deploy)
and opens it
to general traffic. This step may involve adding a deployment to a load balancer,
updating DNS, configuring a service mesh, etc.

**The release stage is optional.** See [default behavior](/waypoint/docs/lifecycle/release#default-behavior)
for more information.

## Configuration

The release is configured using the `release` stanza within an `app`.
This section is optional. If it isn't specified, each deployment is assumed
to be released.

```hcl
app "my-app" {
  release {
    use "aws-alb" {}
  }
}
```

## Default Behavior

If the release stage is not specified,
two different behaviors may occur depending on if the deployment platform
being used supports a default releaser.

### Platform Default Releaser

The deployment platform being used may support what is called a "default
releaser". This means the deployment platform has default release behavior
if an explicit release stage isn't specified. For example, the Kubernetes
platform supports a default releaser that creates a `Service` resource.

In this case, the default releaser will be used automatically if no
`release` configuration is explicitly available in the Waypoint project
configuration file.

### No Releaser

If no default releaser exists for the deployment platform and no
release is configured in the Waypoint project configuration, then each
deploy is expected to already be released.

This behavior matches how deploys may have been considered in the past:
you deploy and it is immediately available to consumers of your application.

In this scenario, it is expected that either the deployment platform makes
the deployments available to traffic or this is handled externally.

## Deployment Pruning

During the release stage, Waypoint will prune unreleased deployments.
By default, Waypoint keeps just one previous deployment for
easy rollback behavior. Any older unreleased deployments are destroyed.

This behavior can be changed using the `-prune` and `-prune-retain` flags
on `waypoint up` and `waypoint release`. The `-prune` flag can be used to
disable pruning completely and `-prune-retain` can be used to specify how
many recent deployments to keep around.

-> **Note:** CLI flags are the only way to customize this today. In the future,
we will support setting defaults on the server side, in the `waypoint.hcl`
file, and via the UI.

### Pruning All Unreleased Deployments

If you don't want to keep any past deployments, specify a value of `0`
for `-prune-retain`:

```shell-session
$ waypoint up -prune-retain=0
...

or

$ waypoint release -prune-retain=0
...
```
