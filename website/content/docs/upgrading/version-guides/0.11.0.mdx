# Upgrading to Waypoint 0.11.0 from 0.10.x

Waypoint 0.10.x can be upgraded to Waypoint 0.11.0 using a [standard upgrade](/waypoint/docs/upgrading#standard-upgrade).
There are some considerations depending on what platform your server is installed on.
There are no breaking changes in the protocol or `waypoint.hcl` configuration file.
However, there was a bug related to the usage of dynamic configuration which will require attention during the upgrade. Those details are below.

## Server Snapshot

Waypoint servers at versions 0.10.4 and 0.10.5 have a bug that prevents
snapshots from being taken if a dynamic configuration source was set using the
`waypoint config source-set` command. If your server is running at either of
these versions and a `waypoint config source-set` command was run, then you
will not be able to take snapshots using the command `waypoint server snapshot`.

To
check if you are affected by the bug in question, run
`waypoint server snapshot`. If this succeeds, disregard the rest of the below
remediation steps. You are unaffected by this bug and can use
`waypoint server upgrade` with no extra steps beyond your normal upgrade
procedure.

If this fails, proceed with the below remediation steps. There are
three options to upgrade to v0.11.0 if you are unable to create snapshots.

The first is, if you do not need a snapshot of the database before upgrading, then
run the server upgrade with the flag `-snapshot=false` to proceed with upgrading:

```shell
$ waypoint server upgrade -snapshot=false
```

The second alternative is to delete all config sources from Waypoint using
`waypoint config source-set` with the `-delete` flag, and then run
`waypoint server upgrade`. After the server is upgraded, you can re-create the
config sources using `waypoint config source-set`.

```shell
# Repeat the command below for each config source that is set; this example
# deletes the globally-scoped Vault config source
waypoint config source-set -delete -type=vault -scope=global
```

The third approach is to use platform-native persistence solutions to back up
the file system where the Waypoint database is stored. This includes Docker,
AWS ECS, Kubernetes, and HashiCorp Nomad. The steps to do this with each of
these platforms are detailed below.

### Docker

The Waypoint server stores data in a single `data.db` file, and in Docker its
default location is `/data/data.db`. In the server data directory, copy the
snapshot data and name the file `waypoint-restore.db`.

Now run:

```shell
waypoint server upgrade -snapshot=false
```

### AWS ECS

The database of a Waypoint server installed to AWS ECS is persisted in a file
system, provided by the Elastic File System (EFS) service of AWS. To preserve
the database during the upgrade, a new EFS volume will need to be created. An
access point will need to be added to this volume as well. This access point's
path must be set to `/waypointserverdata`. The POSIX user and root directory
creation permissions should both have their user and group ID set to `100` and
`1000`, respectively. The access point permissions should be set to `755`.

The data in the old file system must be synchronized to the new one. This may be
done using [AWS DataSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/what-is-datasync.html).
The source location should be configured as your old file system for the
Waypoint server and the destination should be configured as the file system you
just created.

Now run:

```shell
waypoint server upgrade -snapshot=false
```

### Kubernetes

Given that volume snapshots are not part of the core API, as a pre-requisite to
taking a volume snapshot, ensure CRDs are installed first. Once complete, proceed.

Confirm your storage class and add that to the following command to create a
volume snapshot. Then verify your snapshot was created.

```shell-session
$ kubectl get storageclass

$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: waypoint-snapshot
spec:
  volumeSnapshotClassName: <storage-class>
  source:
    persistentVolumeClaimName: data-default-waypoint-server-0
EOF

$ kubectl get volumesnapshot
NAME                READYTOUSE   SOURCEPVC                        SOURCESNAPSHOTCONTENT   RESTORESIZE   SNAPSHOTCLASS   SNAPSHOTCONTENT   CREATIONTIME   AGE
waypoint-snapshot                data-default-waypoint-server-0                                         <storage-class>                                              13s
```

Now run:

```shell
waypoint server upgrade -snapshot=false
```

### HashiCorp Nomad

Taking a snapshot of the Waypoint server's database before an upgrade will
depend on what storage Waypoint was initially setup with. For host mounted
volumes you will need to make a manual backup of the host volume itself and
attempt the upgrade with snapshots disabled.

If you previously installed Waypoint using a CSI driver, it is possible to use
the snapshot feature of the CSI driver to ensure a snapshot of your server is
taken before upgrading. Run the following steps to take a snapshot.

1. Stop Waypoint server
2. Take a snapshot of the volume Waypoint used for server installation in Nomad
3. Verify the snapshot is ready in Nomad before continuing
4. Upgrade Waypoint to 0.11.0
5. Verify Waypoint server version

```shell-session
$ nomad job stop waypoint-server
[...]
  ✓ Deployment "7a885db5" successful

    2023-02-14T15:44:44-08:00
    ID          = 7a885db5
    Job ID      = waypoint-server
    Job Version = 37
    Status      = successful
    Description = Deployment completed successfully

$ nomad volume snapshot create <volume-id> waypoint-0-11-upgrade
Snapshot ID                        Volume ID    Size    Create Time             Ready?
<volume-id>@waypoint-0-11-upgrade  <volume-id>  211MiB  2023-02-14-15:45-08:00  true

$ nomad job inspect waypoint-server > waypoint-server-0.10.json
$ # Make a copy of `waypoint-server.json` and set {"Job": "Stop": false} and the waypoint server image version to "0.11.0" in the "waypoint-server" task group.
$ # Submit the job to nomad to start again.

$ nomad job run -json waypoint-server-0.11.0.json
[...]
  ✓ Deployment "b82dc4a1" successful

    2023-02-14T15:49:12-08:00
    ID          = b82dc4a1
    Job ID      = waypoint-server
    Job Version = 38
    Status      = successful
    Description = Deployment completed successfully
```

Now run:

```shell
waypoint server upgrade -snapshot=false
```

#### Verifying the Server Version with the UI

You can verify the server version by loading the UI and looking at the footer.
You should see a version starting with `v0.11.0`. If you see an earlier version,
your platform may be using an old cached image.

#### Verifying the Server Version with the CLI

You can verify both the CLI version and server version by running:

```shell-session
$ waypoint version
CLI: v0.11.0 (-------)
Server: v0.11.0
```
