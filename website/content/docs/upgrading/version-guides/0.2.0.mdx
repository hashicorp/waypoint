# Upgrading to Waypoint 0.2.0 from 0.1.x

Waypoint 0.1.x can be upgraded to Waypoint 0.2.0 using a [standard upgrade](/docs/upgrading#standard-upgrade).
There are no breaking changes in the protocol or `waypoint.hcl` configuration file. All
Waypoint components (CLI, entrypoint, and server) are forwards and backwards
compatible but we encourge users to upgrade all components to 0.2.x over time.

## Other Considerations

### Server Image

`waypoint install` uses the `hashicorp/waypoint:latest` container image for
Kubernetes, Nomad, and Docker. When upgrading, your platform may require
you to pull the latest image instead of using a cache.

Kubernetes and Nomad both specify an "always pull" policy for `:latest` images
so restarting the Deployment or Job should pull the latest released version.
Docker may require an explicit `docker pull` and container recreate.

#### Verifying the Server Version with the UI

You can verify the server version by loading the UI and looking at the footer.
You should see a version starting with `v0.2`. If you see an earlier version,
your platform may be using an old cached image.

#### Verifying the Server Version with the CLI

You can verify the server version using the following CLI command and inspecting
the log output in the CLI. This command is not a mistake, we don't have a better
way in Waypoint 0.1.x or 0.2.0 to describe the server version. Therefore, we
try to exchange a purposely invalid token with the verbose flag (`-v`) in order
to see the server version advertised.

```shell-session
$ ./waypoint token exchange abcd1234 -v                                           Thu Dec 10 18:48:30 2020

```

In this output, find the line starting with `server version info` and verify
that the `version` key has a version starting with `v0.2`. If it starts
with an older version, your platform may be caching the Waypoint Docker image.
