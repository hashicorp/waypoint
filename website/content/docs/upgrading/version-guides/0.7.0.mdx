# Upgrading to Waypoint 0.7.0 from 0.6.x

Waypoint 0.6.x can be upgraded to Waypoint 0.7.0 using a [standard upgrade](/docs/upgrading#standard-upgrade).

## Breaking Changes

**[v0.7.0](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/releases/tag/v0.7.0)**
* core: `configdynamic` has been renamed to `dynamic`. The existing function
name continues to work but is deprecated and may be removed in a future version.
* plugin/docker: `img`-based Dockerless builds are no longer supported.
Dockerless builds are still fully supported via Kaniko and on-demand
runners that shipped in Waypoint 0.6. Static runners without access to
a Docker daemon can no longer build images.

## Other Considerations

### Server Image

`waypoint install` uses the `hashicorp/waypoint:latest` container image for
Kubernetes, Nomad, and Docker. When upgrading, your platform may require
you to pull the latest image instead of using a cache.

Kubernetes and Nomad both specify an "always pull" policy for `:latest` images
so restarting the Deployment or Job should pull the latest released version.
Docker may require an explicit `docker pull` and container recreate.

#### Verifying the Server Version with the UI

You can verify the server version by loading the UI and looking at the footer.
You should see a version starting with `v0.7`. If you see an earlier version,
your platform may be using an old cached image.

#### Verifying the Server Version with the CLI

You can verify both the CLI version and server version by running:
```shell-session
$ waypoint version
CLI: v0.7.0 (622f37bd1)
Server: v0.7.0
```
