# Upgrade Guides for Specific Versions

This section contains upgrade guides for specific Waypoint versions.

_Please read all the upgrade guides for each version you're upgrading to._ If
you're upgrading from version 0.3.0 to 0.6.0, please read the guide for each
upgrade in between. Each upgrade guide will assume you're already
on the previous version or have at least read the upgrade guide for the previous
version.

~> **Always back up your data before upgrading.** From version 0.2 onwards,
use `waypoint server snapshot` to capture a server snapshot prior to upgrading.
For prior versions, you'll have to manually [copy the database file](/waypoint/docs/server/run/maintenance#path-to-database).
