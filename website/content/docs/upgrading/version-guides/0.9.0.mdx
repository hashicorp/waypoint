# Upgrading to Waypoint 0.9.0 from 0.8.x

Waypoint 0.8.x can be upgraded to Waypoint 0.9.0 using a [standard upgrade](/docs/upgrading#standard-upgrade).
There are some considerations depending on what platform your server is installed on.
There are no breaking changes in the protocol or `waypoint.hcl` configuration file.
Due to the changes in `runner` management, we cannot guarantee that all Waypoint
components (CLI, entrypoint, and server) are forwards and backwards
compatible. We encourge users to have all components on the same version.

## ECS Upgrades

We removed the default value for the flag `-ecs-region`. This was previously set
to `us-west-2`. If you used the default on the install of Waypoint to ECS, you will
need to specify `us-west-2` moving forward.

## Kubernetes Upgrades

With 0.9 comes a significant change in how Waypoint manages express server installs.
Waypoint now uses Helm under the hood to all Waypoint components. If you previously
installed with Helm, you can run a standard Waypoint upgrade.

If you previously installed with the Waypoint express install for Kubernetes,
you will need to snapshot your sever, do a Waypoint server uninstall, complete a
new express install with v0.9.0, and restore your server snapshot. An example is below:

```shell-session

```

## Other Considerations

### Default runner profiles

After an upgrade, you will have two default runner profiles, as the upgrade
will create a new default runner profile with the new server version.

We recommend you remove old runner profiles that depend on older versions of
the `waypoint-odr` image. Additionally, having only one default runner profile
is recommended so you have consistent behavior.

#### Helm installs

With the Helm upgrade, a new runner profile will not be created. We recommend
overwriting the current default runner profile to update the `waypoint-odr`
image version it uses. You can do that by running:

```shell-session
$ waypoint runner profile set -name=01G68E50FKQA2JZM8Q79C0NQE7 -plugin-type=kubernetes -default
```

### Server Image

`waypoint install` uses the `hashicorp/waypoint:latest` container image for
Kubernetes, Nomad, ECS, and Docker. When upgrading, your platform may require
you to pull the latest image instead of using a cache.

Kubernetes and Nomad both specify an "always pull" policy for `:latest` images
so restarting the Deployment or Job should pull the latest released version.
Docker may require an explicit `docker pull` and container recreate.

#### Verifying the Server Version with the UI

You can verify the server version by loading the UI and looking at the footer.
You should see a version starting with `v0.9`. If you see an earlier version,
your platform may be using an old cached image.

#### Verifying the Server Version with the CLI

You can verify both the CLI version and server version by running:

```shell-session
$ waypoint version
CLI: v0.9.0 (622f37bd1)
Server: v0.9.0
```
