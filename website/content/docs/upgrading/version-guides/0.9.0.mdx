# Upgrading to Waypoint 0.9.0 from 0.8.x

Waypoint 0.8.x can be upgraded to Waypoint 0.9.0 using a [standard upgrade](/docs/upgrading#standard-upgrade).
There are some considerations depending on what platform your server is installed on.
There are no breaking changes in the protocol or `waypoint.hcl` configuration file.
Due to the changes in `runner` management, we cannot guarantee that all Waypoint
components (CLI, entrypoint, and server) are forwards and backwards
compatible. We encourge users to have all components on the same version.

## ECS Upgrades

During prerelease testing, we discovered an issue that has exited since the 0.8.1
release, and possibly earlier, that means `waypoint upgrade` does not work on
servers installed on ECS. We found this too late to fix it for the 0.9.0 release,
but plan to fix it for a future release. You can track [the issue here](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/3527).

If you want to upgrade your Waypoint server installed on ECS, you will need to
snapshot your sever, do a Waypoint server uninstall, complete a new express
install with v0.9.0, and restore your server snapshot. Note that the
`waypoint uninstall` command creates a snapshot by default.
An example is in the below [Kubernetes Upgrades](#kubernetes-upgrades) section.

### Change to Region Flag

We removed the default value for the flag `-ecs-region`. This was previously set
to `us-west-2`. If you used the default on the install of Waypoint to ECS, you will
need to specify `us-west-2` moving forward.

## Kubernetes Upgrades

With 0.9 comes a significant change in how Waypoint manages express server installs.
Waypoint now uses Helm under the hood to all Waypoint components. If you previously
installed with Helm, you can run a standard Waypoint upgrade.

If you previously installed with the Waypoint express install for Kubernetes,
you will need to snapshot your sever, do a Waypoint server uninstall, complete a
new express install with v0.9.0, and restore your server snapshot. Note that the
`waypoint uninstall` command does creates a snapshot by default. It is also vitally
important that you set `-delete-context=false` on the uninstall.
An example is below, showing the following steps:

- verifying the Waypoint version
- verifying the server connection by checking the status of a deployed and release app
- uninstalling the server with `delete-context` set to `false`
- upgrading Waypoint CLI as verified by another version check
- re-installing Waypoint server onto k8s
- verifying the installed server version
- getting the context path
- restoring the server snapshot
- overwriting the token in the new context with the token from the previous install's context
- deleting the waypoint-server pod
- verifying the server snapshot has been succesfully restored by checking `waypoint status` again and seeing the same output as before

```shell-session
$ waypoint version

$ waypoint status
Current project statuses in server context "localhost:9701"

The projects listed above represent their current state known
in the Waypoint server. For more information about a project’s applications and
their current state, run ‘waypoint status -project=PROJECT-NAME’.

## Other Considerations

### Default runner profiles

After an upgrade, you will have two default runner profiles, as the upgrade
will create a new default runner profile with the new server version.

We recommend you remove old runner profiles that depend on older versions of
the `waypoint-odr` image. Additionally, having only one default runner profile
is recommended so you have consistent behavior.

#### Helm installs

With the Helm upgrade, a new runner profile will not be created. We recommend
overwriting the current default runner profile to update the `waypoint-odr`
image version it uses. You can do that by running:

```shell-session
$ waypoint runner profile set -name=01G68E50FKQA2JZM8Q79C0NQE7 -plugin-type=kubernetes -default
```

### Server Image

`waypoint install` uses the `hashicorp/waypoint:latest` container image for
Kubernetes, Nomad, ECS, and Docker. When upgrading, your platform may require
you to pull the latest image instead of using a cache.

Kubernetes and Nomad both specify an "always pull" policy for `:latest` images
so restarting the Deployment or Job should pull the latest released version.
Docker may require an explicit `docker pull` and container recreate.

#### Verifying the Server Version with the UI

You can verify the server version by loading the UI and looking at the footer.
You should see a version starting with `v0.9`. If you see an earlier version,
your platform may be using an old cached image.

#### Verifying the Server Version with the CLI

You can verify both the CLI version and server version by running:

```shell-session
$ waypoint version
CLI: v0.9.0 (622f37bd1)
Server: v0.9.0
```
