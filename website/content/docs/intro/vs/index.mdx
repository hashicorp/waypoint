# Waypoint vs. Other Software

It can be difficult to understand how different software compare to each other.
Is one a replacement for the other? Are they complementary? etc. In this
section, we compare Waypoint to other software.

We recommend also reading ["What is Waypoint?"](/docs/intro#what-is-waypoint)
and ["Why Waypoint?"](/docs/intro#why-waypoint). These both will provide
a better understanding of the problems that Waypoint is trying to solve.

Use the navigation to the left to read the comparison of Waypoint to specific systems.

~> These comparisons _are not_ meant to convince you to use Waypoint, and
_are not_ meant to be negative towards other software. Our goal is only to
provide a better understanding of how software does or does not overlap with
Waypoint, and where Waypoint does things differently. If you believe any of the
stated facts are incorrect, please open a GitHub Issue and we will resolve the inconsistency.
