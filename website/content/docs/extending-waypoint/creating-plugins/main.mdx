A Waypoint plugin is just a Go binary; if you look at `main.go` you will see the `main` function. The `sdk.Main`
function sets up the Waypoint SDK and registers the interfaces for the go-plugin system for you. All you need to do is
pass `Main` the components your Plugin implements using the `sdk.WithComponents` function. Since this is the default
template, all the different plugin components are registered.

```go
func main() {
	// sdk.Main allows you to register the components which should
	// be included in your plugin
	// Main sets up all the go-plugin requirements

	sdk.Main(sdk.WithComponents(
		// Comment out any components which are not
		// required for your plugin
		&builder.Builder{},
		&registry.Registry{},
		&platform.Platform{},
		&release.ReleaseManager{},
	))
}
```

The plugin you will build in this guide only implements the `Builder` component so you can remove the other components.
Your final `Main` block should look like the following:

```go
	sdk.Main(sdk.WithComponents(
		&builder.Builder{},
	))
```
