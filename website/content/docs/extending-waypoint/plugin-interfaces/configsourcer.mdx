# ConfigSourcer

https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-plugin-sdk/component#ConfigSourcer

`ConfigSourcer` can be implemented to dynamically load configs from external
sources such as [Vault](/plugins/vault#vault-configsourcer) and [Terraform Cloud](/plugins/terraform-cloud#terraform-cloud-configsourcer).
Waypoint uses dynamic config sourcers to run alongside the application. The
plugin interface expects a `ReadFunc()` for reading configuration and a
`StopFunc()` for stopping configuration sourcing.

```go
// ConfigSourcer can be implemented by plugins that support sourcing
// dynamic configuration for running applications.
//
// This plugin type runs alongside the application. The initial config loading
// will block the application start so authors should attempt to source
// configuration as quickly as possible.
type ConfigSourcer interface {
  // ReadFunc returns the function for reading configuration.
  //
  // The returned function can start a background goroutine to more efficiently
  // watch for changes. The entrypoint will periodically call Read to check for
  // updates.
  //
  // If the configuration changes for any dynamic configuration variable,
  // the entrypoint will call Stop followed by Read, so plugins DO NOT need
  // to implement config diffing. Plugins may safely assume if Read is called
  // after a Stop that the config is new, and that subsequent calls have the
  // same config.
  //
  // Read is called for ALL defined configuration variables for this source.
  // If ANY change, Stop is called followed by Read again. Only one sourcer
  // is active for a set of configs.
  ReadFunc() interface{}

  // StopFunc returns a function for stopping configuration sourcing.
  // You can return nil if stopping is not necessary or supported for
  // this sourcer.
  //
  // The stop function should stop any background processes started with Read.
  StopFunc() interface{}
}
```

Below is an abbreviated example of the Terraform Cloud ConfigSourcer `ReadFunc()`.

```go
// ReadFunc implements component.ConfigSourcer
func (cs *ConfigSourcer) ReadFunc() interface{} {
        return cs.read
}


func (cs *ConfigSourcer) read(
        ctx context.Context,
        log hclog.Logger,
        reqs []*component.ConfigRequest,
) ([]*pb.ConfigSource_Value, error) {
        // Setup our lock
        cs.cacheMu.Lock()
        defer cs.cacheMu.Unlock()

        // Set up client to read from Terraform Cloud

        // Then iterate over each request in `reqs` to load the value from TFC

        // Return the results
}
```
