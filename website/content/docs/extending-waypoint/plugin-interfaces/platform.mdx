# Platform

https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-plugin-sdk/component#Platform

The `Platform` component is where you handle interaction between Waypoint and the destination platform. It is handled
through the implementation of the DeployFunc interface and optionally the `PlatformReleaser` interface.

The Platform component is responsible for deploying your application to the destination platform, for example say you
wish to deploy the application to Google Cloud Run, the DeployFunc callback would be where you would define the interaction
with the Cloud Run APIs.

A platform component can be created by implementing the Platform interface, Platform has a single function DeployFunc from
which you return a function which will be called by Waypoint.

```go
type Platform interface {
  DeployFunc() interface{}
}
```

The following code snippet shows an example of the implementation of `DeployFunc`, the signature for the function returned
from DeployFunc can be defined to accept the Default Mappers, in addition it can accept the data model which was returned
from the `Registry` component.

```go
type Platform struct {
  // Other component fields
}

func (p *Platform) DeployFunc() interface{} {
  return d.Deploy
}

func (p *Platform) Deploy(
  ctx context.Context,
  ji *component.JobInfo,
  artifact *registry.Artifact,
  hc history.Client,
  ui terminal.UI,
) (*Deployment, error)
```
