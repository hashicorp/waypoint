# Internal Values

Internal values are static or [dynamic](/waypoint/docs/app-config/dynamic)
configuration values that can be referenced by environment variables,
[files](/waypoint/docs/app-config/files), or other internal variables to compose
values. An example common usecase is building a database connection string
which requires a database host, username, password, etc. that may come from difference sources.

## Using Internal Values

Internal values are declared in the `waypoint.hcl` file in the
[`config` stanza](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/config). The example below configures
an internal value that reads a database username and host from a Terraform
output and then combines them in an environment variable:

```hcl
config {
  internal = {
    "db_host" = dynamic("terraform-cloud", {
      organization = "mycorp"
      workspace = "databases"
      output = "db_host"
    })

    "db_user" = dynamic("terraform-cloud", {
      organization = "mycorp"
      workspace = "databases"
      output = "db_user"
    })
  }

  env = {
    "DB_ADDR" = "${config.internal.db_user}@${config.internal.db_host}"
  }
}
```

The internal values `db_host` and `db_user` are never exposed directly
to the application. Instead, only the combined value created in the
`DB_ADDR` env var is exposed.

If the dynamic value of the database host or user changes, the environment
variable will subsequently be updated and the application will be restarted
using standard application restart behavior.
