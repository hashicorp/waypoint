# AWS ECS

-> For a step by step guide, visit [this AWS ECS tutorial](/waypoint/tutorials/deploy-aws/aws-ecs).

## Builders

ECS uses Docker images for building, which are generated by these builders:

- [Docker](/waypoint/plugins/docker)
- [Cloud Native Buildpacks](/waypoint/plugins/pack)

@include "components/registry-aws-ecr.mdx"

@include "components/platform-aws-ecs.mdx"

@include "components/task-aws-ecs.mdx"
