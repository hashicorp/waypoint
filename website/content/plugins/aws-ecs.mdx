# AWS ECS

-> For a step by step guide, visit [this AWS ECS tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/waypoint/aws-ecs?in=waypoint/deploy-aws).

## Builders

ECS uses Docker images for building, which are generated by these builders:

- [Docker](./docker)
- [Cloud Native Buildpacks](./pack)

@include "components/registry-aws-ecr.mdx"

@include "components/platform-aws-ecs.mdx"

@include "components/task-aws-ecs.mdx"
