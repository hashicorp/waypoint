# Nomad

-> For a step by step tutorial, visit [HashiCorp
Learn](/waypoint/tutorials/get-started-nomad).

## Builders

Nomad is a simple, flexible scheduler and workload orchestrator. Nomad uses
Docker images for building, which are generated by these builders:

- [Docker](/waypoint/plugins/docker)
- [Cloud Native Buildpacks](/waypoint/plugins/pack)

## Nomad Client

A Nomad API client is used for deploying to the Nomad platform with each of the
Nomad plugins. This client uses environment variables to connect to a
Nomad cluster. These can be configured with [runner config](/waypoint/docs/runner/config#environment-variables).

- `NOMAD_CA_CERT`
- `NOMAD_CLIENT_CERT`
- `NOMAD_CLIENT_KEY`
- `NOMAD_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY`
- `NOMAD_TOKEN`

-> **Note**: This is not an all-inclusive list. Please refer to the [GoLang Nomad API
client documentation](/nomad/api-docs/libraries-and-sdks).
