# Nomad

-> For a step by step tutorial, visit [HashiCorp
Learn](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/waypoint/get-started-nomad).

## Builders

Nomad uses Docker images for building, which are generated by these builders:

- [Docker](./docker)
- [Cloud Native Buildpacks](./pack)

-> When using a local [Docker](./docker) builder with Nomad, set a [registry](.docker#docker-registry) stanza with `local = true` to allow Nomad access to locally built images.

@include "components/platform-nomad.mdx"

@include "components/platform-nomad-jobspec.mdx"
