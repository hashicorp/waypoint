## vault (configsourcer)

Read configuration values from Vault.

### Examples

```hcl
config {
  env = {
    "DATABASE_USERNAME" = configdynamic("vault", {
      path = "database/creds/my-role"
      key = "username"
    })

    "DATABASE_PASSWORD" = configdynamic("vault", {
      path = "database/creds/my-role"
      key = "password"
    })

    "DATABASE_HOST" = configdynamic("vault", {
      path = "kv/database-host"
    })
  }
}
```

### Required Parameters

These parameters are used in `configdynamic` for [dynamic configuration syncing](/docs/app-config/dynamic).

#### key

The key in the structured response from the secret to read the value.

This value can be a direct key such as `password` or it can be a [JSON pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) string to retrieve a nested value. This is because Vault secrets can be any arbitrary structure, not just simple key/value mappings. An example of a JSON pointer value would be `/data/username/`. When using the Vault KV secret backend, the key typically has to be prefixed with `/data` because the Vault KV API returns the data nested under the `data` key. For example: `/data/username`.

- Type: **string**

#### path

The Vault path to read the secret.

Within a single application, multiple dynamic values that use the same path will only read the value once. This allows multiple keys from a single secret to be extracted into multiple values. The example above shows this functionality by reading the username and password into separate values. When using the Vault KV secret backend, the path is usually `<mount>/data/<key>`. For example, if you wrote data with `vault kv put secret/myapp` then the key for Waypoint must be `secret/data/myapp`. This can be confusing but is caused by the fact that the Vault API is what Waypoint uses and the Vault CLI does this automatically for KV.

- Type: **string**

### Optional Parameters

This plugin has no optional parameters.

### Source Parameters

The parameters below are used with `waypoint config set-source` to configure
the behavior this plugin. These are _not_ used in `configdynamic` calls. The
parameters used for `configdynamic` are in the previous section.

#### Required Parameters

This plugin has no required source parameters.

#### Optional Parameters

##### addr

The address to the Vault server.

If this is not set, the VAULT_ADDR environment variable will be read.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

##### agent_addr

If this is not set, Vault agent will not be used. This should only be set if you're deploying to an environment with a Vault agent.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

##### auth_method

The authentication method to use for Vault.

This can be one of: `aws`, `kubernetes`. When this is set, configuration fields prefixed with the auth method type should be set, if required. Configuration fields prefixed with non-matching auth method types will be ignored (except for type validation). If no auth method is set, Vault assumes proper environment variables are set for Vault to find and connect to the Vault server. When this is set, `auth_method_mount_path` is required.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

This is required when `auth_method` is set.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**
