## docker (task)

Launch a Docker container as a task.

If a Docker server is available (either locally or via environment variables
such as "DOCKER_HOST"), then it will be used to start the container.

### Interface

### Examples

```hcl
task {
  use "docker" {
		force_pull = true
  }
}
```

### Required Parameters

#### client_config

#### binds

A 'source:destination' list of folders to mount onto the container from the host.

A list of folders to mount onto the container from the host. The expected format for each string entry in the list is `source:destination`. So for example: `binds: ["host_folder/scripts:/scripts"]`.

#### debug_containers

- Type: **bool**

#### force_pull

- Type: **bool**

#### labels

A map of key/value pairs to label the docker container with.

A map of key/value pair(s), stored in docker as a string. Each key/value pair must be unique. Validiation occurs at the docker layer, not in Waypoint. Label keys are alphanumeric strings which may contain periods (.) and hyphens (-).

- Type: **map of string to string**

#### networks

A list of strings with network names to connect the container to.

A list of networks to connect the container to. By default the container will always connect to the `waypoint` network.

The cpu shares that the tasks should use.

##### resources.memory

The amount of memory to use. Defined as '512MB', '44kB', etc.

- Type: **string**

#### static_environment

Environment variables to expose to the application.

These variables are used to control all of a container's modes, such as configuring it to start a web app vs a background worker. These environment variables should not be common configuration variables normally set in `waypoint config`.

- Type: **map of string to string**
- **Optional**

### Output Attributes

Output attributes can be used in your `waypoint.hcl` as [variables](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables) via [`artifact`](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/artifact) or [`deploy`](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/deploy).

#### id
