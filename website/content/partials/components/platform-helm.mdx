## helm (platform)

Deploy to Kubernetes from a Helm chart. The Helm chart can be a local path
or a chart in a repository.

### Entrypoint Functionality

Waypoint [entrypoint functionality](/waypoint/docs/entrypoint#functionality) such
as logs, exec, app configuration, and more require two properties to be true:

1. The running image must already have the Waypoint entrypoint installed
   and configured as the entrypoint. This should happen in the build stage.

2. Proper environment variables must be set so the entrypoint knows how
   to communicate to the Waypoint server. **This step happens in this
   deployment stage.**

**Step 2 does not happen automatically.** You must manually set the entrypoint
environment variables using the [templating feature](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/functions/template).
These must be passed in using Helm values (i.e. the chart must make
environment variables configurable).

This is documented in more detail with a full example in the
[Kubernetes Helm Deployment documentation](/waypoint/docs/platforms/kubernetes/helm-deploy).

#### URL Service

If you want your workload to be accessible by the
[Waypoint URL service](/waypoint/docs/url), you must set the PORT environment variable
within the pod with your web service and also be using the Waypoint
entrypoint (documented in the previous section).

The PORT environment variable should be the port that your web service
is listening on that the URL service will connect to. See one of the examples
below for more details.

### Interface

### Examples

```hcl
// Configuring an image to match the build. This assumes the chart
// has a value named "deployment.image".
deploy {
  use "helm" {
    chart = "${path.app}/chart"

    set {
      name  = "deployment.image"
      value = artifact.name
    }
  }
}
```

### Required Parameters

These parameters are used in the [`use` stanza](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/use) for this plugin.

#### chart

The name or path of the chart to install.

If you're installing a local chart, this is the path to the chart. If you're installing a chart from a repository (have the `repository` configuration set), then this is the name of the chart in the repository.

- Type: **string**

#### name

Name of the Helm release.

This must be globally unique within the context of your Helm installation.

- Type: **string**

#### set

A single value to set. This can be repeated multiple times.

This sets a single value. Separate nested values with a `.`. This is the same as the `--set` flag on `helm install`.

- Type: **list of struct { Name string "hcl:\"name,attr\""; Value string "hcl:\"value,attr\""; Type string "hcl:\"type,optional\"" }**

### Optional Parameters

These parameters are used in the [`use` stanza](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/use) for this plugin.

#### context

The kubectl context to use, as defined in the kubeconfig file.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

#### create_namespace

Create Namespace if it doesn't exist.

This option will instruct Helm to create a namespace if it doesn't exist.

- Type: **bool**
- **Optional**

#### devel

True to considered non-released chart versions for installation.

This is equivalent to the `--devel` flag to `helm install`.

- Type: **bool**
- **Optional**
- Default: false

#### driver

The Helm storage driver to use.

This can be one of `configmap`, `secret`, `memory`, or `sql`. The SQL connection string can not be set currently so this must be set on the runners.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**
- Default: secret

#### kubeconfig

Path to the kubeconfig file to use.

If this isn't set, the default lookup used by `kubectl` will be used.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**
- Environment Variable: **KUBECONFIG**

#### namespace

Namespace to deploy the Helm chart.

This will be created if it does not exist (see create_namespace). This defaults to the current namespace of the auth settings.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

#### repository

URL of the Helm repository that contains the chart.

This only needs to be set if you're NOT using a local chart.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

#### skip_crds

Do not create CRDs.

This option will tell Helm to skip the creation of CRDs.

- Type: **bool**
- **Optional**

#### values

Values in raw YAML to configure the Helm chart.

These values are usually loaded from files using HCL functions such as `file` or templating with `templatefile`. Multiple values will be merged using the same logic as the `-f` flag with Helm.

- Type: **list of string**
- **Optional**

#### version

The version of the chart to install.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

### Output Attributes

Output attributes can be used in your `waypoint.hcl` as [variables](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables) via [`artifact`](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/artifact) or [`deploy`](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/deploy).

#### release

- Type: **string**
