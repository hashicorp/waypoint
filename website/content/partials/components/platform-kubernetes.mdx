## kubernetes (platform)

Deploy the application into a Kubernetes cluster using Deployment objects.

### Interface

### Examples

```hcl
deploy "kubernetes" {
	image_secret = "registry_secret"
	replicas = 3
	probe_path = "/_healthz"
}
```

### Required Parameters

These parameters are used in the [`use` stanza](/docs/waypoint-hcl/use) for this plugin.

#### probe (category)

Configuration to control liveness and readiness probes.

Probe describes a health check to be performed against a container to determine whether it is alive or ready to receive traffic.

##### probe.failure_threshold

Number of times a liveness probe can fail before the container is killed.

FailureThreshold \* TimeoutSeconds should be long enough to cover your worst case startup times.

- Type: **uint**
- **Optional**
- Default: 5

##### probe.initial_delay

Time in seconds to wait before performing the initial liveness and readiness probes.

- Type: **uint**
- **Optional**
- Default: 5

##### probe.timeout

Time in seconds before the probe fails.

- Type: **uint**
- **Optional**
- Default: 5

### Optional Parameters

These parameters are used in the [`use` stanza](/docs/waypoint-hcl/use) for this plugin.

#### annotations

Annotations to be added to the application pod.

Annotations are added to the pod spec of the deployed application. This is useful when using mutating webhook admission controllers to further process pod events.

- Type: **map of string to string**
- **Optional**

#### context

The kubectl context to use, as defined in the kubeconfig file.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

#### image_secret

Name of the Kubernetes secrete to use for the image.

This references an existing secret, waypoint does not create this secret.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

#### kubeconfig

Path to the kubeconfig file to use.

By default uses from current user's home directory.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

#### labels

A map of key value labels to apply to the deployment pod.

- Type: **map of string to string**
- **Optional**

#### namespace

Namespace to target deployment into.

Namespace is the name of the Kubernetes namespace to apply the deployment in. This is useful to create deployments in non-default namespaces without creating kubeconfig contexts for each.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

#### ports

A map of ports and options that the application is listening on.

Used to define and expose multiple ports that the application is listening on for the container in use. Available keys are 'port', 'name' , 'host_port', and 'host_ip'. Ports defined will be TCP protocol.

- Type: **list of map of string to string**
- **Optional**

#### probe_path

The HTTP path to request to test that the application is running.

Without this, the test will simply be that the application has bound to the port.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

#### replicas

The number of replicas to maintain.

If the replica count is maintained outside waypoint, for instance by a pod autoscaler, do not set this variable.

- Type: **int32**
- **Optional**

#### resources

A map of resource limits and requests to apply to a pod on deploy.

Resource limits and requests for a pod. limits and requests options must start with either 'limits\_' or 'requests\_'. Any other options will be ignored.

- Type: **map of string to string**
- **Optional**

#### scratch_path

A path for the service to store temporary data.

A path to a directory that will be created for the service to store temporary data using tmpfs.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

#### service_account

Service account name to be added to the application pod.

Service account is the name of the Kubernetes service account to add to the pod. This is useful to apply Kubernetes RBAC to the application.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

#### service_port

The TCP port that the application is listening on.

By default, this config variable is used for exposing a single port for the container in use. For multi-port configuration, use 'ports' instead.

- Type: **uint**
- **Optional**
- Default: 3000

#### static_environment

Environment variables to control broad modes of the application.

Environment variables that are meant to configure the application in a static way. This might be control an image that has multiple modes of operation, selected via environment variable. Most configuration should use the waypoint config commands.

- Type: **map of string to string**
- **Optional**

### Output Attributes

Output attributes can be used in your `waypoint.hcl` as [variables](/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables) via [`artifact`](/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/artifact) or [`deploy`](/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/deploy).

#### id

- Type: **string**

#### name

- Type: **string**
