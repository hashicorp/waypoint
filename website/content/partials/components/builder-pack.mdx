## pack (builder)

Create a Docker image using CloudNative Buildpacks.

**This plugin must either be run via Docker or inside an ondemand runner**.

### Interface

- Input: **component.Source**
- Output: **pack.Image**

### Examples

```hcl
build {
  use "pack" {
	builder     = "heroku/buildpacks:20"
	disable_entrypoint = false
  }
}
```

### Mappers

#### Allow pack images to be used as normal docker images

- Input: **pack.Image**
- Output: **docker.Image**

### Required Parameters

This plugin has no required parameters.

### Optional Parameters

These parameters are used in the [`use` stanza](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/use) for this plugin.

#### builder

The buildpack builder image to use.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**
- Default: heroku/buildpacks:20

#### buildpacks

The exact buildpacks to use.

If set, the builder will run these buildpacks in the specified order. They can be listed using several [URI formats](https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-developer-guide/specific-buildpacks).

- Type: **list of string**
- **Optional**

#### disable_entrypoint

If set, the entrypoint binary won't be injected into the image.

The entrypoint binary is what provides extended functionality such as logs and exec. If it is not injected at build time the expectation is that the image already contains it.

- Type: **bool**
- **Optional**

#### ignore

File patterns to match files which will not be included in the build.

Each pattern follows the semantics of .gitignore. This is a summarized version:

1. A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator
	 for readability.

2. A line starting with # serves as a comment. Put a backslash ("\")
	 in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.

3. Trailing spaces are ignored unless they are quoted with backslash ("\").

4. An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file
	 excluded by a previous pattern will become included again. It is not
	 possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is
	 excluded. Git doesn’t list excluded directories for performance reasons,
	 so any patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they
	 are defined. Put a backslash ("\") in front of the first "!" for
	 patterns that begin with a literal "!", for example, "\!important!.txt".

5. If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of the
	 following description, but it would only find a match with a directory.
	 In other words, foo/ will match a directory foo and paths underneath it,
	 but will not match a regular file or a symbolic link foo (this is
	 consistent with the way how pathspec works in general in Git).

6. If the pattern does not contain a slash /, Git treats it as a shell glob
	 pattern and checks for a match against the pathname relative to the
	 location of the .gitignore file (relative to the top level of the work
	 tree if not from a .gitignore file).

7. Otherwise, Git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for
	 consumption by fnmatch(3) with the FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in the
	 pattern will not match a / in the pathname. For example,
	 "Documentation/*.html" matches "Documentation/git.html" but not
	 "Documentation/ppc/ppc.html" or "tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html".

8. A leading slash matches the beginning of the pathname. For example,
	 "/*.c" matches "cat-file.c" but not "mozilla-sha1/sha1.c".

9. Two consecutive asterisks ("**") in patterns matched against full
	 pathname may have special meaning:

		i.   A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories.
				 For example, "** /foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere,
				 the same as pattern "foo". "** /foo/bar" matches file or directory
				 "bar" anywhere that is directly under directory "foo".

		ii.  A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**"
				 matches all files inside directory "abc", relative to the location
				 of the .gitignore file, with infinite depth.

		iii. A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches
				 zero or more directories. For example, "a/** /b" matches "a/b",
				 "a/x/b", "a/x/y/b" and so on.

		iv.  Other consecutive asterisks are considered invalid.

- Type: **list of string**
- **Optional**

#### process_type

The process type to use from your Procfile. if not set, defaults to `web`.

The process type is used to control over all container modes, such as configuring it to start a web app vs a background worker.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

#### static_environment

Environment variables to expose to the buildpack.

These environment variables should not be run of the mill configuration variables, use waypoint config for that. These variables are used to control over all container modes, such as configuring it to start a web app vs a background worker.

- Type: **map of string to string**
- **Optional**

### Output Attributes

Output attributes can be used in your `waypoint.hcl` as [variables](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables) via [`artifact`](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/artifact) or [`deploy`](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/deploy).
