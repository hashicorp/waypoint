## docker (builder)

Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.

If a Docker server is available (either locally or via environment variables
such as "DOCKER_HOST"), then "docker build" will be used to build an image
from a Dockerfile.

### Dockerless Builds

Many hosted environments, such as Kubernetes clusters, don't provide access
to a Docker server. In these cases, it is desirable to perform what is called
a "dockerless" build: building a Docker image without access to a Docker
daemon. Waypoint supports dockerless builds.

Waypoint will automatically attempt a dockerless build if a Docker daemon
is not available and no remote Docker server environment variables are set.

Dockerless builds require user namespaces to be enabled. This is a host-level
setting that is often not enabled by default. For GKE, you must not use ContainerOS.
For AKS (Azure) and EKS (AWS), you must use a custom AMI that has user namespaces
enabled. Please search for your distro how to enable user namespaces, it is
usually a single line configuration.

### Interface

- Output: **docker.Image**

### Examples

```hcl
build {
  use "docker" {
	buildkit    = false
	disable_entrypoint = false
  }
}
```

### Required Parameters

This plugin has no required parameters.

### Optional Parameters

These parameters are used in the [`use` stanza](/docs/waypoint-hcl/use) for this plugin.

#### buildkit

If set, use the buildkit builder from Docker.

- Type: **bool**
- **Optional**

#### disable_entrypoint

If set, the entrypoint binary won't be injected into the image.

The entrypoint binary is what provides extended functionality such as logs and exec. If it is not injected at build time the expectation is that the image already contains it.

- Type: **bool**
- **Optional**

#### dockerfile

The path to the Dockerfile.

Set this when the Dockerfile is not APP-PATH/Dockerfile.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

### Output Attributes

Output attributes can be used in your `waypoint.hcl` as [variables](/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables) via [`artifact`](/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/artifact) or [`deploy`](/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/deploy).

#### image

- Type: **string**

#### location

- Type: **docker.isImage_Location**

#### tag

- Type: **string**
