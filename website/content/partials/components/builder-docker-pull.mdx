## docker-pull (builder)

Use an existing, pre-built Docker image

This builder will automatically inject the Waypoint entrypoint. You
can disable this with the "disable_entrypoint" configuration.

If you wish to rename or retag an image, use this along with the
"docker" registry option which will rename/retag the image and then
push it to the specified registry.

### Interface

- Input: **component.Source**
- Output: **docker.Image**

### Examples

```hcl
build {
  use "docker-pull" {
    image = "gcr.io/my-project/my-image"
    tag   = "abcd1234"
  }
}
```

### Required Parameters

These parameters are used in the [`use` stanza](/docs/waypoint-hcl/use) for this plugin.

#### image

The image to pull.

This should NOT include the tag (the value following the ':' in a Docker image). Use `tag` to define the image tag.

- Type: **string**

#### tag

The tag of the image to pull.

- Type: **string**

### Optional Parameters

These parameters are used in the [`use` stanza](/docs/waypoint-hcl/use) for this plugin.

#### disable_entrypoint

If set, the entrypoint binary won't be injected into the image.

The entrypoint binary is what provides extended functionality such as logs and exec. If it is not injected at build time the expectation is that the image already contains it.

- Type: **bool**
- **Optional**

#### encoded_auth

The authentication information to log into the docker repository.

WARNING: be very careful to not leak the authentication information by hardcoding it here. Use a helper function like `file()` to read the information from a file not stored in VCS.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

### Output Attributes

Output attributes can be used in your `waypoint.hcl` as [variables](/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables) via [`artifact`](/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/artifact) or [`deploy`](/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/deploy).
