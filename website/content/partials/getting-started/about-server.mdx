## About the Server Workflow

When you deploy your app with Waypoint, your computer (the Waypoint client) connects
to the Waypoint server to initiate the Waypoint workflow. The client then registers
itself as a runner, allowing Waypoint to run builds on it.

When the build is completed, the Waypoint server sends the build artifacts, such as a container image,
to the artifact registry of your choice. Multiple Waypoint clients can concurrently
connect to a single server to deploy and release applications.
