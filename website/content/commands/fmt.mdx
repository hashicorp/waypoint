# Waypoint Fmt

Command: `waypoint fmt`

Rewrite waypoint.hcl configuration to a canonical format

@include "commands/fmt_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint fmt [options] [FILE]`


  Rewrite a waypoint.hcl file to a canonical format.

  This only works for HCL-formatted Waypoint configuration files. JSON-formatted
  files do not work and will result in an error.

  If FILE is not specified, then the current directory will be searched
  for a "waypoint.hcl" file. If FILE is "-" then the content will be read
  from stdin.

  This command does not validate the waypoint.hcl configuration. This will
  work for older and newer configuration formats.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.

#### Command Options

- `-write` - Overwrite the input file. If this is false, the formatted output will be written to STDOUT. This has no effect when formatting from STDIN or when using the -check flag. The default is true.
- `-check` - Check if the input is formatted. Exit status will be 0 if all input is properly formatted and exit status 3 otherwise. The default is false.
