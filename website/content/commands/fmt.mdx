# Waypoint Fmt

Command: `waypoint fmt`

Rewrite waypoint.hcl configuration to a canonical format

@include "commands/fmt_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint fmt [options]`

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-workspace=<string>` - Workspace to operate in.

#### Command Options

- `-write` - Overwrite the input file. If this is false, the formatted output will be written to STDOUT. This has no effect when formatting from STDIN.
