# Waypoint Pipeline run

Command: `waypoint pipeline run`

Manually execute a pipeline by name.

@include "commands/pipeline-run_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint pipeline run [options] <pipeline-name>`

Run a pipeline by name. If run outside of a project dir, a '-project' flag is
required. Before running a requested pipeline, this command will sync
pipeline configs so it runs the most up to date configuration version for a
pipeline.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.

#### Operation Options

- `-label=<key=value>` - Labels to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.
- `-local` - True to use a local runner to execute the operation, false to use a remote runner.
  If unset, Waypoint will automatically determine where the operation will occur,
  defaulting to remote if possible.
- `-remote-source=<key=value>` - Override configurations for how remote runners source data. This is specified to the data source type being used in your configuration. This is used for example to set a specific Git ref to run against.
- `-var=<key=value>` - Variable value to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.
- `-var-file=<string>` - HCL or JSON file containing variable values to set for this operation. If any "_.auto.wpvars" or "_.auto.wpvars.json" files are present, they will be automatically loaded.

#### Command Options

- `-id=<string>` - Run a pipeline by ID.
