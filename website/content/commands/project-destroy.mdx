# Waypoint Project destroy

Command: `waypoint project destroy`

Delete the specified project and optionally destroy its resources.

@include "commands/project-destroy_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint project destroy [options] -p <project>`


  Delete the project and all resources created for all apps in the project, within
  the platform each app was deployed to.

  You must explicitly specify the project to destroy with the -project or -p flag.

  You can skip destroying app resources with the -skip-destroy-resources flag.

  You can skip the manual confirmation prompt with the -auto-approve flag.
#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.

#### Operation Options

- `-label=<key=value>` - Labels to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.
- `-local` - True to use a local runner to execute the operation, false to use a remote runner. 
If unset, Waypoint will automatically determine where the operation will occur, 
defaulting to remote if possible.
- `-remote-source=<key=value>` - Override configurations for how remote runners source data. This is specified to the data source type being used in your configuration. This is used for example to set a specific Git ref to run against.
- `-var=<key=value>` - Variable value to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.
- `-var-file=<string>` - HCL or JSON file containing variable values to set for this operation. If any "*.auto.wpvars" or "*.auto.wpvars.json" files are present, they will be automatically loaded.

#### Command Options

- `-skip-destroy-resources` - Skips destroying resources created for the Waypoint project. The default is false.
- `-auto-approve` - Destroy the project and all of its resources without confirmation. The default is false.
