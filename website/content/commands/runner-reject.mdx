# Waypoint Runner reject

Command: `waypoint runner reject`

Reject a pending runner

@include "commands/runner-reject_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint runner reject [options] ID`


  Reject a pending or adopted runner with the given ID.

  The ID can be retrieved via the "waypoint runner list" command or
  the API. This ID must be the ID of a currently registered runner. The
  runner can be in any state: new, preadopted, adopted, or rejected. This
  will move the runner to the rejected state.

  A rejected runner will never be sent any configuration or jobs. Runners
  that were previously adopted will continue their currently running jobs
  and then will not receive any further jobs.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.
