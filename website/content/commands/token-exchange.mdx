# Waypoint Token exchange

Command: `waypoint token exchange`

Exchange an invite token.

@include "commands/token-exchange_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint token exchange [options]`


  Exchange an invite token for a normal token for login.

The "waypoint token" commands are deprecated. They have been replaced with
the "waypoint user" set of commands. Everything that was possible with
"waypoint token" is now possible with "waypoint user". For example,
"waypoint token new" is now "waypoint user token".

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.

#### Command Options

- `-token=<string>` - The invite token to exchange.
