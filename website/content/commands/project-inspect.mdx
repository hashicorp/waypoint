# Waypoint Project inspect

Command: `waypoint project inspect`

Inspect the details of a project.

@include "commands/project-inspect_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint project inspect [project-name]`

Inspect the details of a given project.

Projects usually map to a single version control repository and contain
exactly one "waypoint.hcl" configuration. A project may contain multiple
applications.

A project is registered via the web UI, "waypoint project apply",
or "waypoint init".

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.

- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.

#### Command Options

- `-json` - Output project information as JSON. The default is false.
