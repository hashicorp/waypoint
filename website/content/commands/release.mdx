# Waypoint Release

Command: `waypoint release`

Release a deployment

@include "commands/release_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint release [options]`

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-workspace=<string>` - Workspace to operate in.

#### Operation Options

- `-label=<key=value>` - Labels to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.
- `-remote` - True to use a remote runner to execute. This defaults to false
  unless 'runner.default' is set in your configuration.
- `-remote-source=<key=value>` - Override configurations for how remote runners source data. This is specified to the data source type being used in your configuration. This is used for example to set a specific Git ref to run against.

#### Command Options

- `-repeat` - Re-release if deploy is already released.
- `-deployment=<string>` (`-d`) - Release the specified deployment.
- `-prune` - Prune old unreleased deployments.
- `-prune-retain=<int>` - The number of unreleased deployments to keep. If this isn't set or is set to any negative number, then this will default to 1 on the server. If you want to prune all unreleased deployments, set this to 0.
