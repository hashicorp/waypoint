## Usage

Usage: `waypoint runner profile set [OPTIONS]`

Create or update a runner profile.

This will register a new runner profile with the given options. If
a runner profile with the same id already exists, this will update the
existing runner profile using the fields that are set.

Waypoint will use a runner profile to spawn containers for
various kinds of work as needed on the platform requested during any given
lifecycle operation.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.

#### Command Options
