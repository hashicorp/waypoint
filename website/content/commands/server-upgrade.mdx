# Waypoint Server upgrade

Command: `waypoint server upgrade`

Upgrades Waypoint server in the current context to the latest version

@include "commands/server-upgrade_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint server upgrade [options]`

Upgrade Waypoint server in the current context to the latest version or the
server image version specified. By default, Waypoint will upgrade to server
version "hashicorp/waypoint:latest". Before upgrading, a snapshot of the
server will be taken in case of any upgrade failures.

If a runner was installed via "waypoint install" then that runner will also
be upgraded to the latest version after the server is upgraded. Any other
manually installed runners will not be automatically upgraded.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.

#### Command Options

- `-snapshot-name=<string>` - Filename to write the snapshot to. If no name is specified, by default a timestamp will be appended to the default snapshot name.
- `-snapshot` - Enable or disable taking a snapshot of Waypoint server prior to upgrades.

#### docker Options

- `-docker-server-image=<string>` - Docker image for the Waypoint server.
- `-docker-odr-image=<string>` - Docker image for the Waypoint On-Demand Runners. This will default to the server image with the name (not label) suffixed with '-odr'.

#### ecs Options

- `-ecs-cluster=<string>` - Configures the Cluster to upgrade.
- `-ecs-server-image=<string>` - Docker image for the Waypoint server.
- `-ecs-region=<string>` - Configures which AWS region to install into.

#### kubernetes Options

- `-k8s-advertise-internal` - Advertise the internal service address rather than the external. This is useful if all your deployments will be able to access the private service address. This will default to false but will be automatically set to true if the external host is detected to be localhost.
