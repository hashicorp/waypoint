@include "commands/server-run_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint server run [options]`

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-workspace=<string>` - Workspace to operate in.

#### Command Options

- `-db=<string>` - Path to the database file.
- `-listen-grpc=<string>` - Address to bind to for gRPC connections.
- `-listen-http=<string>` - Address to bind to for HTTP connections. Required for the UI.
- `-disable-ui` - Disable the embedded web interface
- `-url-enabled` - Enable the URL service.
- `-url-api-addr=<string>` - Address to Waypoint URL service API
- `-url-api-insecure` - True if TLS is not enabled for the Waypoint URL service API
- `-url-control-addr=<string>` - Address to Waypoint URL service control API
- `-url-control-token=<string>` - Token for the Waypoint URL server control API.
- `-url-auto-app-hostname` - Whether apps automatically get a hostname on deploy.
- `-advertise-addr=<string>` - Address to advertise for the server. This is used by the entrypoints
  binaries to communicate back to the server. If this is blank, then
  the entrypoints will not communicate to the server. Features such as
  logs, exec, etc. will not work.
- `-advertise-tls` - If true, the advertised address should be connected to with TLS.
- `-advertise-tls-skip-verify` - Do not verify the TLS certificate presented by the server.
- `-accept-tos` - Pass to accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to use the Waypoint URL Service. This is required if the URL service is enabled and you're using the HashiCorp-provided URL service rather than self-hosting. See the privacy policy at https://hashicorp.com/privacy and the ToS at https://waypointproject.io/terms
