# Waypoint Deployment deploy

Command: `waypoint deployment deploy`

Deploy a pushed artifact

@include "commands/deployment-deploy_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint deployment deploy [options]`

Alias: `waypoint deploy`

Deploy an application. This will deploy the most recent successful
pushed artifact by default. You can view a list of recent artifacts
using the "artifact list" command.

By default, "waypoint deploy" automatically performs a release. This behavior
can be disabled by using the "-release=false" flag.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.

#### Operation Options

- `-label=<key=value>` - Labels to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.
- `-local` - True to use a local runner to execute the operation, false to use a remote runner.
  If unset, Waypoint will automatically determine where the operation will occur,
  defaulting to remote if possible.
- `-remote-source=<key=value>` - Override configurations for how remote runners source data. This is specified to the data source type being used in your configuration. This is used for example to set a specific Git ref to run against.
- `-var=<key=value>` - Variable value to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.
- `-var-file=<string>` - HCL or JSON file containing variable values to set for this operation. If any "_.auto.wpvars" or "_.auto.wpvars.json" files are present, they will be automatically loaded.

#### Command Options

- `-release` - Release this deployment immediately.
