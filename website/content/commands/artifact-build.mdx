## Usage

Usage: `waypoint artifact build [options]`

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.

- `-workspace=<string>` - Workspace to operate in.

#### Operation Options

- `-label=<key=value>` - Labels to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.

unless 'runner.default' is set in your configuration.
- `-remote-source=<key=value>` - Override configurations for how remote runners source data. This is specified to the data source type being used in your configuration. This is used for example to set a specific Git ref to run against.

#### Command Options
