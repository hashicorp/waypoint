# Waypoint Logs

Command: `waypoint logs`

Show log output from the current application deployment

@include "commands/logs_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint logs [options]`


  Show log output from all current deployments.

  The logs will include output from deployments that aren't released.
  As new deployments are made, their logs will appear automatically.

  The six character text after the date on a log line is the last six
  characters of the instance ID. This can be used to trace any logs back
  to a specific deployment or filter out certain log messages.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-workspace=<string>` - Workspace to operate in.
