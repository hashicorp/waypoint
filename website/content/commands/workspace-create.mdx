# Waypoint Workspace create

Command: `waypoint workspace create`

Create a workspace with a given name.

@include "commands/workspace-create_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint workspace create [options] <name>`

Create a workspace in Waypoint with the given value. If a workspace with the
given name already exists, no error will be returned. This command ignores
the -workspace flag.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.
