# Waypoint Destroy

Command: `waypoint destroy`

Delete all the resources created for an app

@include "commands/destroy_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint destroy [options]`

Delete all resources created for an app in the current workspace.

The workspace can continue to be used after this call, this just deletes
all the resources created for this app up to this point.

This functionality must be supported by the plugins in use and is dependent
on their behavior. The expected behavior is that any physical resources created
as part of deploys and releases are destroyed. For example, any load balancers,
VMs, containers, etc.

This targets one app in one workspace. You must call this for each workspace
you've used if you want to destroy everything.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-workspace=<string>` - Workspace to operate in.

#### Operation Options

- `-label=<key=value>` - Labels to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.
- `-remote` - True to use a remote runner to execute. This defaults to false
  unless 'runner.default' is set in your configuration.
- `-remote-source=<key=value>` - Override configurations for how remote runners source data. This is specified to the data source type being used in your configuration. This is used for example to set a specific Git ref to run against.
- `-var=<key=value>` - Variable value to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.
- `-var-file=<string>` - HCL or JSON file containing variable values to set for this operation. If any "_.auto.wpvars" or "_.auto.wpvars.json" files are present, they will be automatically loaded.

#### Command Options

- `-auto-approve` - Confirm destroying all resources.
