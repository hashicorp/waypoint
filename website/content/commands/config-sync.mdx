# Waypoint Config sync

Command: `waypoint config sync`

Synchronize declared variables and pipeline configs in a waypoint.hcl

@include "commands/config-sync_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint config sync [options]`

Synchronize declared application configuration in the waypoint.hcl file
for existing and new deployments.

Conflicting configuration keys will be overwritten. Configuration keys
that do not exist in the waypoint.hcl file but exist on the server will not
be deleted.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.
