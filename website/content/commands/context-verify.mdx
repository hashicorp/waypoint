# Waypoint Context verify

Command: `waypoint context verify`

Verify server access with a context

@include "commands/context-verify_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint context verify [options] [NAME]`

Verify the connection information for a context is valid.

This will use the provided context (or default) configuration,
connect to the server, and perform test API calls to ensure the
connection information is valid.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.
