## Usage

Usage: `waypoint server bootstrap [options]`

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-workspace=<string>` - Workspace to operate in.

#### Connection Options

- `-server-addr=<string>` - Address for the server.
- `-server-tls` - True if the server should be connected to via TLS.
- `-server-tls-skip-verify` - True to skip verification of the TLS certificate advertised by the server.

#### Command Options

- `-context-create=<string>` - Create a CLI context for this bootstrapped server. The context name will be the value of this flag. If this is an empty string, a context will not be created
- `-context-set-default` - Set the newly bootstrapped server as the default CLI context. This only has an effect if -context-create is non-empty.
