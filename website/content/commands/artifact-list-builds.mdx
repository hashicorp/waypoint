# Waypoint Artifact list-builds

Command: `waypoint artifact list-builds`

List builds.

@include "commands/artifact-list-builds_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint artifact list-builds [options]`

List artifacts created from a build. An artifact is the result of a build or
registry. This is the metadata only. The binary contents of an artifact are
expected to be stored in a registry.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.

#### Command Options

- `-workspace-all` - List builds in all workspaces for this project and application. The default is false.
- `-long-ids` - Show long identifiers rather than sequence numbers. The default is false.
