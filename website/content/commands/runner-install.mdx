# Waypoint Runner install

Command: `waypoint runner install`

Install a Waypoint runner to Kubernetes, Nomad, ECS, or Docker

@include "commands/runner-install_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint runner install [options]`

Install a Waypoint runner to the specified platform: kubernetes, nomad, ecs,
or docker.

This command will attempt to install a runner for the server configured in
the current Waypoint context. It will adopt the runner after installation,
unless the '-skip-adopt' flag is set to true.

To further customize the runner installation, you may pass advanced flag
options specified in the documentation for the 'runner agent' command. To set
these values, include a '--' after the full argument list for 'install',
followed by these advanced flag options. As an example, to set a label k/v
on the runner profile that is generated as part of adopting a runner during
the install, the command would be:

    waypoint runner install -server-addr=localhost:9701 -server-tls-skip-verify -- -label=environment=primary
