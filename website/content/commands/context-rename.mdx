# Waypoint Context rename

Command: `waypoint context rename`

Rename a context.

@include "commands/context-rename_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint context rename [options] FROM TO`

Rename a context FROM to TO.

This will error if FROM does not exist. This will overwrite TO if it
exists. If the current default is FROM, the default will be set to TO.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.
