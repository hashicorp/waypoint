Command: `waypoint login`

Log in to a Waypoint server

@include "commands/login_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint login [options]`

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-workspace=<string>` - Workspace to operate in.

#### Connection Options

- `-server-addr=<string>` - Address for the server.
- `-server-tls` - True if the server should be connected to via TLS.
- `-server-tls-skip-verify` - True to skip verification of the TLS certificate advertised by the server.

#### Command Options

- `-auth-method=<string>` - Auth method to use for login. This will default to the only available auth method if only one exists.
- `-token=<string>` - Auth with a token. This will force auth-method to 'token'. This works with both login and invite tokens.
