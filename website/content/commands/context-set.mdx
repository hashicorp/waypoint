# Waypoint Context set

Command: `waypoint context set`

Set a property of the current context.

@include "commands/context-set_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint context set [options]`

Sets a property of the current context. The only property supported at this
time is -workspace.

To use this command, use the global -workspace flag to set the default
workspace for the current context.

To restore this CLI context to use the default workspace, use
-workspace=default

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.
