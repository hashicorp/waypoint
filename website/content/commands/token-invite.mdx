Request a new invite token.

@include "commands/token-invite_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint token invite [options]`

Request a new invite token. This token can be exchanged for a normal token to login.

The "waypoint token" commands are deprecated. They have been replaced with
the "waypoint user" set of commands. Everything that was possible with
"waypoint token" is now possible with "waypoint user". For example,
"waypoint token new" is now "waypoint user token".

#### Global Options

- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.

#### Command Options

- `-lifetime=<duration>` - How long the invite token will valid for, starting now. The default is 5m0s.
