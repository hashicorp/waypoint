#### Global Options

#### Operation Options

- `-label=<key=value>` - Labels to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.

  unless 'runner.default' is set in your configuration.
- `-remote-source=<key=value>` - Override configurations for how remote runners source data. This is specified to the data source type being used in your configuration. This is used for example to set a specific Git ref to run against.
- `-var=<key=value>` - Variable value to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.
- `-var-file=<string>` - HCL or JSON file containing variable values to set for this operation. If any "_.auto.wpvars" or "_.auto.wpvars.json" files are present, they will be automatically loaded.

#### Command Options

- `-prune` - Prune old unreleased deployments.
