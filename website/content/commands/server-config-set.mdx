## Usage

Usage: `waypoint server config-set [options]`

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.

- `-workspace=<string>` - Workspace to operate in.

#### Command Options

- `-advertise-addr=<string>` - Address to advertise for the server. This is used by the entrypoints
  binaries to communicate back to the server. If this is blank, then
  the entrypoints will not communicate to the server. Features such as
  logs, exec, etc. will not work.
- `-advertise-tls` - If true, the advertised address should be connected to with TLS.
- `-advertise-tls-skip-verify` - Do not verify the TLS certificate presented by the server.
