# Waypoint Hostname register

Command: `waypoint hostname register`

Register a hostname to route to your apps.

@include "commands/hostname-register_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint hostname register [hostname]`

Register a hostname with the URL service to route to your apps.

The URL service must be enabled and configured with the Waypoint server.
This will output the fully qualified domain name that should begin
routing immediately.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.
