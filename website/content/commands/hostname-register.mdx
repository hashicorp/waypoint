Register a hostname to route to your apps.

@include "commands/hostname-register_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint hostname register [hostname]`

Register a hostname with the URL service to route to your apps.

The URL service must be enabled and configured with the Waypoint server.
This will output the fully qualified domain name that should begin
routing immediately.

#### Global Options
