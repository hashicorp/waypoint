# Waypoint Server install

Command: `waypoint server install`

Install the Waypoint server to Kubernetes, Nomad, ECS, or Docker

@include "commands/server-install_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint server install [options]`

Alias: `waypoint install`

Installs a Waypoint server to an existing platform. The platform should be
specified as kubernetes, nomad, ecs, or docker.

This will also install a single Waypoint runner by default. This enables
remote operations out of the box, such as polling a Git repository. This can
be disabled by specifying "-runner=false".

By default, this will also automatically create a new default CLI context
(see "waypoint context") so the CLI will be configured to use the newly
installed server.

This command will require you to accept the Waypoint Terms of Service
and Privacy Policy for the Waypoint URL service by specifying the "-accept-tos"
flag. This only applies to the Waypoint URL service. You may disable the
URL service by manually running the server. If you disable the URL service,
you do not need to accept any terms.

To further customize the server installation, you may pass advanced flag options
specified in the documentation for the 'server run' command. To set these values,
include a '--' after the full argument list for 'install', followed by these
advanced flag options. As an example, to set the server log level to trace
and disable the UI, the command would be:

    waypoint install -platform=docker -accept-tos -- -vvv -disable-ui

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.

#### Command Options

- `-accept-tos` - Pass to accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to use the Waypoint URL Service.
