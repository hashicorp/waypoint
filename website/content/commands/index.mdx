# Waypoint Commands (CLI)

Waypoint is controlled via a very easy to use command-line interface (CLI). Waypoint
is only a single command-line application: `waypoint`. This application then takes a
subcommand such as `artifact` or `deployment`. The complete list of subcommands is in
the navigation to the left.

The waypoint CLI is a well-behaved command line application. In erroneous cases, a
non-zero exit status will be returned. It also responds to -h and --help as you'd most
likely expect.

To view a list of the available commands at any time, just run waypoint with no arguments:

```shell-session
$ waypoint
Usage: waypoint [-version] [-help] [-autocomplete-(un)install] <command> [args]

Common commands:
    build        Build a new versioned artifact from source
    deploy       Deploy a pushed artifact
    release      Release a deployment
    up           Perform the build, deploy, and release steps for the app

    artifact        Artifact and build management
    auth-method     Auth method management

```

To get help for any specific command, pass the -h flag to the relevant subcommand.
For example, to see help about the up subcommand:

```shell-session
$ waypoint up -h
Usage: waypoint up [options]

  Perform the build, deploy, and release steps for the app.

Global Options:

  -workspace=<string>
      Workspace to operate in. Defaults to 'default'. The default is default.

Operation Options:

  -label=<key=value>
      Labels to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.

  -remote
      True to use a remote runner to execute. This defaults to false unless
      'runner.default' is set in your configuration. The default is false.

  -remote-source=<key=value>
      Override configurations for how remote runners source data. This is
      specified to the data source type being used in your configuration. This
      is used for example to set a specific Git ref to run against.
```

Running `waypoint -autocomplete-install` will add the waypoint autocomplete capability
so you can do `waypoint <tab>` on commands. Running `waypoint -autocomplete-uninstall`
will remove it. Please note that this will modify your shell init script, so you will
need to reload your shell.
