# Waypoint Server snapshot

Command: `waypoint server snapshot`

Write a backup of the server data

@include "commands/server-snapshot_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint server snapshot [<filename>]`

Generate a snapshot from the current server and write it to a file specified
by the given name. If no name is specified and standard out is not a terminal,
the backup will be written to standard out. Using a name of '-' will force writing
to standard out.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.
