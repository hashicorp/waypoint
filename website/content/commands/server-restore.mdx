# Waypoint Server restore

Command: `waypoint server restore`

Stage a snapshot on the current server for data restoration

@include "commands/server-restore_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint server restore [-exit] [<filename>]`

Stage a backup snapshot within the current server. The data in the snapshot is not restored
immediately, but rather staged such that on the next server start, it will be restored.

If -exit is passed, the server process will exit after staging the data. This allows a process
monitor to restart the server, where it will see the staged snapshot and restore the data.

If -exit is not passed, an operator must restart the server manually to finish the restoration
process.

The argument should be to a file written previously by 'waypoint server snapshot'.
If no name is specified and standard input is not a terminal, the backup will read from
standard input. Using a name of '-' will force reading from standard input.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.

#### Command Options

- `-exit` - After restoring, the server should exit so it can be restarted. The default is false.
