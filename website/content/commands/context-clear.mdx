# Waypoint Context clear

Command: `waypoint context clear`

Unset the default context.

@include "commands/context-clear_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint context clear`


  This unsets any default context.

  This does not delete any contexts. There are two use cases to not have
  a default set: (1) forcing yourself to specify a context to use or
  (2) operating in local (non-server) mode.

  For (2), you may also set the value of the "WAYPOINT_CONTEXT" environment
  variable to "-" which will force a local mode operation if supported by
  the project.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation. The default is false.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.
