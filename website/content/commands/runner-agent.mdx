# Waypoint Runner agent

Command: `waypoint runner agent`

Run a runner for executing remote operations.

@include "commands/runner-agent_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint runner agent [options]`

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-workspace=<string>` - Workspace to operate in.

#### Operation Options

- `-label=<key=value>` - Labels to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.
- `-remote` - True to use a remote runner to execute. This defaults to false 
unless 'runner.default' is set in your configuration.
- `-remote-source=<key=value>` - Override configurations for how remote runners source data. This is specified to the data source type being used in your configuration. This is used for example to set a specific Git ref to run against.

#### Command Options

- `-enable-dynamic-config` - Allow dynamic config to be created when an exec plugin is used.
- `-liveness-tcp-addr=<string>` - If this is set, the runner will open a TCP listener on this address when it is running. This can be used as a liveness probe endpoint. The TCP server serves no other purpose.
