## Usage

Usage: `waypoint artifact push [options]`

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-workspace=<string>` - Workspace to operate in.

#### Operation Options

- `-label=<key=value>` - Labels to set for this operation. Can be specified multiple times.

unless 'runner.default' is set in your configuration.
