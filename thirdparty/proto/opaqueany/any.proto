message Any {
  // A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
  // protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
  // one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
  // the fully qualified name of the type (as in
  // `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
  // (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).
  //
  // In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
  // expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
  // scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
  // server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:
  //
  // * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
  // * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
  //   value in binary format, or produce an error.
  // * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
  //   URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
  //   lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
  //   on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
  //   breaking changes.)
  //
  // Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
  // protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
  // type.googleapis.com.
  //
  // Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
  // used with implementation specific semantics.
