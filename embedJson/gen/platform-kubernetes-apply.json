   "description": "\nDeploy Kubernetes resources directly from a single file or a directory of YAML\nor JSON files.\n\nThis plugin lets you use any pre-existing set of Kubernetes resource files\nto deploy to Kubernetes. This plugin supports all the features of Waypoint.\nYou may use Waypoint's [templating features](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/functions/template)\nto template the resources with information such as the artifact from\na previous build step, entrypoint environment variables, etc.\n\n### Requirements\n\nThis plugin requires \"kubectl\" to be installed since this plugin works by\nsubprocessing to \"kubectl apply\". Other Waypoint Kubernetes plugins sometimes\nuse the API directly but this plugin requires \"kubectl\".\n\n\"kubectl\" must also be configured to access your Kubernetes cluster. You\nmay specify an alternate kubeconfig file using the \"kubeconfig\" configuration\nparameter. If this isn't specified, the default kubectl lookup paths will be\nused.\n\n### Artifact Access\n\nYou may use Waypoint's [templating features](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/functions/template)\nto access information such as the artifact from the build or push stages.\nAn example below shows this by using `templatedir` mixed with\nvariables such as `artifact.image` to dynamically configure the\nDocker image within a Kubernetes Deployment.\n\n### Entrypoint Functionality\n\nWaypoint [entrypoint functionality](/waypoint/docs/entrypoint#functionality) such\nas logs, exec, app configuration, and more require two properties to be true:\n\n1. The running image must already have the Waypoint entrypoint installed\n  and configured as the entrypoint. This should happen in the build stage.\n\n2. Proper environment variables must be set so the entrypoint knows how\n  to communicate to the Waypoint server. **This step happens in this\n  deployment stage.**\n\n**Step 2 does not happen automatically.** You must manually set the entrypoint\nenvironment variables using the [templating feature](/waypoint/docs/waypoint-hcl/functions/template).\nOne of the examples below shows the entrypoint environment variables being\ninjected.\n\n### URL Service\n\nIf you want your workload to be accessible by the\n[Waypoint URL service](/waypoint/docs/url), you must set the PORT environment variable\nwithin the pod with your web service and also be using the Waypoint\nentrypoint (documented in the previous section).\n\nThe PORT environment variable should be the port that your web service\nis listening on that the URL service will connect to. See one of the examples\nbelow for more details.\n\n",
