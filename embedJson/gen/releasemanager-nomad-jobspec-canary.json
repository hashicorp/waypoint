   "description": "\nPromotes a Nomad canary deployment initiated by a Nomad jobspec deployment.\n\nIf your Nomad deployment is configured to use canaries, this releaser plugin lets\nyou promote (or fail) the canary deployment. You may also target specific task\ngroups within your job for promotion, if you have multiple task groups in your canary\ndeployment.\n\n-\u003e **Note:** Using the `-prune=false` flag is recommended for this releaser. By default,\nWaypoint prunes and destroys all unreleased deployments and keeps only one previous\ndeployment. Therefore, if `-prune=false` is not set, Waypoint may delete\nyour job via \"pruning\" a previous version. See [deployment pruning](/waypoint/docs/lifecycle/release#deployment-pruning)\nfor more information.\n\n### Release URL\n\nIf you want the URL of the release of your deployment to be published in Waypoint,\nyou must set the meta 'waypoint.hashicorp.com/release_url' in your jobspec. The\nvalue specified in this meta field will be published as the release URL for your\napplication. In the future, this may source from Consul.\n\n",
