parameter {
  key         = "ignore"
  description = "file patterns to match files which will not be included in the build\nEach pattern follows the semantics of .gitignore. This is a summarized version:\n\n1. A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator\n\t for readability.\n\n2. A line starting with # serves as a comment. Put a backslash (\"\\\")\n\t in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.\n\n3. Trailing spaces are ignored unless they are quoted with backslash (\"\\\").\n\n4. An optional prefix \"!\" which negates the pattern; any matching file\n\t excluded by a previous pattern will become included again. It is not\n\t possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is\n\t excluded. Git doesnâ€™t list excluded directories for performance reasons,\n\t so any patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they\n\t are defined. Put a backslash (\"\\\") in front of the first \"!\" for\n\t patterns that begin with a literal \"!\", for example, \"\\!important!.txt\".\n\n5. If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of the\n\t following description, but it would only find a match with a directory.\n\t In other words, foo/ will match a directory foo and paths underneath it,\n\t but will not match a regular file or a symbolic link foo (this is\n\t consistent with the way how pathspec works in general in Git).\n\n6. If the pattern does not contain a slash /, Git treats it as a shell glob\n\t pattern and checks for a match against the pathname relative to the\n\t location of the .gitignore file (relative to the top level of the work\n\t tree if not from a .gitignore file).\n\n7. Otherwise, Git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for\n\t consumption by fnmatch(3) with the FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in the\n\t pattern will not match a / in the pathname. For example,\n\t \"Documentation/*.html\" matches \"Documentation/git.html\" but not\n\t \"Documentation/ppc/ppc.html\" or \"tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html\".\n\n8. A leading slash matches the beginning of the pathname. For example,\n\t \"/*.c\" matches \"cat-file.c\" but not \"mozilla-sha1/sha1.c\".\n\n9. Two consecutive asterisks (\"**\") in patterns matched against full\n\t pathname may have special meaning:\n\n\t\ti.   A leading \"**\" followed by a slash means match in all directories.\n\t\t\t\t For example, \"** /foo\" matches file or directory \"foo\" anywhere,\n\t\t\t\t the same as pattern \"foo\". \"** /foo/bar\" matches file or directory\n\t\t\t\t \"bar\" anywhere that is directly under directory \"foo\".\n\n\t\tii.  A trailing \"/**\" matches everything inside. For example, \"abc/**\"\n\t\t\t\t matches all files inside directory \"abc\", relative to the location\n\t\t\t\t of the .gitignore file, with infinite depth.\n\n\t\tiii. A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches\n\t\t\t\t zero or more directories. For example, \"a/** /b\" matches \"a/b\",\n\t\t\t\t \"a/x/b\", \"a/x/y/b\" and so on.\n\n\t\tiv.  Other consecutive asterisks are considered invalid."
