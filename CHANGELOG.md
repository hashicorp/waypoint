## 0.2.0 (December 10, 2020)

FEATURES:

* **Application config syncing with Kubernetes (ConfigMaps), Vault, Consul, and AWS SSM**;
Automatically sync environment variable values with remote sources and restart your
application when those values change. [GH-810]
* **Access to Artifact, Deploy Metadata**: `registry` and `deploy` configuration can use 
`artifact.*` variable syntax to access metadata from the results of those stages. 
The `release` configuration can use `artifact.*` and `deploy.*` to access metadata.
For example: `image = artifact.image` for Docker-based builds. [GH-757]
* **`template` Functions**: `templatefile`, `templatedir`, and `templatestring` functions
allow you to template files, directories, and strings with the variables and functions
available to your Waypoint configuration. 
* **`path` Variables**: you can now use `path.project`, `path.app`, and `path.pwd` as
variables in your Waypoint file to specify paths as relative to the project (waypoint.hcl
file), app, or pwd of the CLI invocation.
* **Server snapshot/restore**: you can now use the CLI or API to take and restore online
snapshots. Restoring snapshot data requires a server restart but the restore operation 
can be staged online. [GH-870]
