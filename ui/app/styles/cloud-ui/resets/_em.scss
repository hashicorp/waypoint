/*
  RESET: em
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  An EM reset is unnecessary because EMs are (by design) meant to be relative
  units.  It is perfectly fine to let its value fluctuate as needed by the app.
  Additionally, <body> inherits the font-size of <html>, by default
  (thus 1em = 1rem).  If a consumer requires a different EM value, it can be
  defined in their own stylesheet and it shouldn't affect the design system
  modular scale.

  +----------+
  | WARNING! |
  +----------+
  Altering the body font-size (the value of 1em) may result
  in unexpected side effects.

  font-size: 1rem; // 1em = 1rem
