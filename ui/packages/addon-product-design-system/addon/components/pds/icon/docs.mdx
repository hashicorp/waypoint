# Icon

This component makes use of [ember-svg-jar](https://github.com/ivanvotti/ember-svg-jar)
to inline SVG icons with a square (1:1) aspect ratio.  This allows for
contextual styling of the inlined SVG markup via CSS.

## Configuration

**This Ember addon does not include any icons!**

Please follow installation and configuration instructions for
[@hashicorp/structure-icons](https://github.com/hashicorp/structure-icons)
to make full use of this component.


## Legal
**Do not use this component for 3rd-party logos and trademarks!**

Third party partners provide strict legal guidelines on how their logos and
trademarks must be displayed.  Because this component inlines SVG markup, its
design conflicts with those legal guidelines, because it enables open
modification of the SVG image via CSS.

If you need to apply a 3rd-party logo/trademark, use an `<img>` element instead.
An `<img>` element allows far fewer CSS override capabilities, which reduces
risk of legal noncompliance.


## Syntax

```hbs
<Pds::Icon
  @type={{string}}
/>
```
<Props of="PdsIcon" />


## Styling
Styles are scoped to the `.pdsIcon` selector.

```scss
@use "pds/components/icon";
```

## Accessibility
Because rendered content is intended to be visual, the rendered `<svg>` element
will always apply the `[aria-hidden="true"]` attribute in order to prevent
screen readers from trying to announce SVG content.
