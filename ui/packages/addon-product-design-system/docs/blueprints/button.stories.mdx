# Button


## Basic (text-only)
Assitive technologies will use the inner text of the button as the button
label.  There's no additional markup required. This is the simplest button
you can define.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Text Only">{{
    template: hbs`<button>Press Me</button>`
  }}</Story>
</Preview>


## Icon-Only
Because icons are non-textual by nature, you have to add some additional
attributes and/or markup to define an accessible label.

The simplest technique is to define an `aria-label` attribute on the `button`.
This will override any resolved labels that are derived from button contents.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Icon Only with Aria Label">{{
    template: hbs`
      <button aria-label="cook bacon">
        <Pds::Icon @type="test-icon" />
      </button>
    `
  }}</Story>
</Preview>

An alternative technique make use of CSS to define a "visually-hidden" `span`
child element, containing only text content, to use as the button label.

This technique takes advantage of the default label text resolution demonstrated
in the [Basic](#basic-text-only) section above, but it applies CSS styling to
hide the text from sighted users.

This technique is also known as "screen reader only" elements in many popular
web development libraries.

(See [helpers/visuallyHidden](?path=/docs/sass-helpers-visuallyhidden--page) for more details.)

<Preview>
  <Story name="Icon Only with Visually-Hidden Label">{{
    template: hbs`
      <button>
        <span class="pds--visuallyHidden">eat bacon</span>
        <Pds::Icon @type="test-icon" />
      </button>
    `
  }}</Story>
</Preview>


## Image-Only
Similar to the [Icon-Only](#icon-only) section, `img` elements are also
non-textual content.

If your `img` has `[alt]` text defined _(which you should always do)_,
the `[alt]` text will be used as the button label if no other technique
is implemented.  While this sounds tempting to do, this default behavior
should be avoided, because `[alt]` text is meant to describe the image,
not act as an accessible button label.

There are a couple of techniques you can use to define your button label.

The first (and simplest) is to add the `[aria-label]` attribute to the
`button` (just like in the [Icon-only](#icon-only) section above).

<Preview>
  <Story name="Image Only with Aria Label" height="100px">{{
    template: hbs`
      <button aria-label="pony icon">
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/32" alt="elephant icon" />
      </button>
    `,
  }}</Story>
</Preview>

The second technique is to go with the visually-hidden `span` technique.
However, you'll also need to add the `[aria-hidden="true"]` attribute to
your `img` element in order to exclude the image `[alt]` text from being
part of the button label.

(See [helpers/visuallyHidden](?path=/docs/sass-helpers-visuallyhidden--page) for more details.)

<Preview>
  <Story name="Image Only with Visually-Hidden Label" height="100px">{{
    template: hbs`
      <button>
        <span class="pds--visuallyHidden">rainbow icon</span>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/32" alt="thunderstorm icon" aria-hidden="true" />
      </button>
    `
  }}</Story>
</Preview>


## Mixed (Text + Icon)

Text and Icons in the same button are pretty straightforward in regards to
defining the button label.  However, it proves difficult to apply various
CSS layout techniques if your text is left as a plain HTML text node.
To remedy this problem, it's recommended that you wrap your `button` text
in a `span` element, so that your text can be targeted with CSS selectors.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Text Before Icon">{{
    template: hbs`
      <button>
        <span>Text on Left</span>
        <Pds::Icon @type="test-icon" />
      </button>
    `
  }}</Story>
  <Story name="Text After Icon">{{
    template: hbs`
      <button>
        <Pds::Icon @type="test-icon" />
        <span>Text on Right</span>
      </button>
    `
  }}</Story>
  <Story name="Text Between Icons">{{
    template: hbs`
      <button>
        <Pds::Icon @type="test-icon" />
        <span>Text Between</span>
        <Pds::Icon @type="test-icon" />
      </button>
    `
  }}</Story>
  <Story name="Text Around Icon">{{
    template: hbs`
      <button>
        <span>Text</span>
        <Pds::Icon @type="test-icon" />
        <span>Around</span>
      </button>
    `
  }}</Story>
</Preview>


## Image + Icon
Image and Icon siblings within a `button` inherit the same problems as if they
were the only child.  The simplest means of defining a button label is setting
the `[aria-label]` attribute on `button`.  Review the [Icon-only](#icon-only)
and [Image-Only](#image-only) sections above for further details.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Image Before Icon">{{
    template: hbs`
      <button aria-label="image left of icon">
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/32" alt="godzilla" />
        <Pds::Icon @type="test-icon" />
      </button>
    `
  }}</Story>
  <Story name="Image After Icon">{{
    template: hbs`
      <button aria-label="image left of icon">
        <Pds::Icon @type="test-icon" />
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/32" alt="godzilla" />
      </button>
    `
  }}</Story>
