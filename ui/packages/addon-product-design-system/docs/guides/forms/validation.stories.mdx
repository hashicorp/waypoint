## Markup

### Field Errors

1. Use an unordered list (`<ul>`) to mark up error messages.
    * Most of the time, there's likely to be only a single error.  However, to remain
      flexible for varible amounts of content, you should assume that multiple errors
      can be displayed at a time.
2. End each error message with punctuation.
    * This allows for a more natural speach cadence when screen readers announce each error.

__Example:__
```html
<ul>
  <li>
    <Pds::ErrorMessage>
      Error 1
    </Pds::ErrorMessage>
  </li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>
    <Pds::ErrorMessage>
      Error N
    </Pds::ErrorMessage>
  </li>
</ul>
```


## Styling

[TODO: Add Description]


### Visually Invalid

Visually "invalid" styling has to be applied _explicitly_ by custom application
business logic (or a 3rd-party validation library) and will be applied
regardless of [logical validity](#logical-validity).

Visually invalid styles should only be applied via the following CSS block:

```css
.pds-invalid input,
input.pds-invalid {
  /* apply "invalid" styling here */
}
```


### Logical Validity

Logically `:invalid` inputs are recognized by browser CSS engines in order to
apply styling based on the results of native
[HTML5 Constraint Validation](#constraint-validation) logic.  In contrast
with visually invalid styling, logically `:valid` inputs will not be styled to
appear invalid.

Logically invalid styles should only be applied via the following CSS block:

```css
.pds-dirty input,
input.pds-dirty {
  /* apply "invalid" styling here */
}
```


#### Touched

Currently, there is no known way, with CSS alone, to apply `:invalid` styles
based on user interaction with the input.  Consider a `[required`] text input
that is rendered empty (blank/missing value) on page load.  The input is
considered logically `:invalid`, because there is no value present to satisfy
the "required" constraint.  If styles were applied strictly based on logical
validity, a newly-rendered form would display a bunch of invalid fields.  This
doesn't provide a pleasant user experience, because the user hasn't had the
chance to interact with the form, yet it's already communicating that something
is wrong.

In order to avoid this experience, `:invalid` styles should only be applied if
the `.pds-touched` class is present on the input or a close ancestor.  This
class should be added using JavaScript based on the designed form interaction
flow.


## Constraint Validation

Logical validity (i.e., `:valid` and `:invalid` pseudo-classes) requires the use
of the [HTML 5 Constraint Validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Constraint_validation)
in order to inform the browser of the validity of the input value.
