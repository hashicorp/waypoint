# Why do we have a "Terraform" case in Waypoint? We copied much of the
# formatting logic and this test verifies a lot of it.
#
# This test case is intended to cover many of the main formatting
# rules of "terraform fmt" at once. It's fine to add new stuff in
# here, but you can also add other _in.tf/_out.tf pairs in the
# same directory if you want to test something complicated that,
# for example, requires specific nested context.
#
# The input file of this test intentionally has strange whitespace
# alignment, because the goal is to see the fmt command fix it.
# If you're applying batch formatting to all .tf files in the
# repository (or similar), be sure to skip this one to avoid
# invalidating the test.
